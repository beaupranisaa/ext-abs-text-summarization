0,32300397,"The university aims to reduce the number of student places by 1,010 over the next three years. ""The potential negative impact, not just on the university but on the local economy is very significant,"" he said. The Education Minister Stephen Farry said he recognised that some students might now choose to study in other areas of the UK because of the cuts facing Northern Ireland's universities. DEL's budget was reduced by £62m earlier this year, and its budget for higher education institutions fell from £203m to £186m, a reduction of 8.2%. The cut in undergraduate places will come into effect from September 2015. ""Some people will now be forced to look to opportunities in other parts of Great Britain and may not return to our economy,"" he said. What's happening is we're going backwards. ""If we're not competitive we will not attract the best students, and we will not attract the best staff."" ""The loss of any place is damaging to our economy, all subjects teach our young people critical skills."" The BBC understands that there are no immediate plans to close departments or courses, but that the cuts in funding may put some departments and courses at risk. Queen's vice-chancellor Patrick Johnston said the cuts had the potential to damage the reputation of the university. The move is in response to an £8m cut in the subsidy received from the Department of Employment and Learning (DEL). Just under £100m, a third of the university's income, comes from the Northern Ireland Executive. ""Defunding our investment in skills, particularly at a time when we're trying to grow the economy does not make a lot of sense. It will be cutting jobs and student places, but it has not yet revealed how many. There are currently around 17,000 full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students at the university, and around 3,800 staff. Queen's has a current intake of around 4,500 undergraduates per year. ""It's the last thing we want to do, but we have to begin to focus on those areas where we can grow the organisation and develop it - it's clear we can no longer depend on the public purse to fund tuition. Ulster University announced in February that it was dropping 53 courses. Job losses will be among both academic and non-academic staff and Queen's says no compulsory redundancies should be required.",Queen's University Belfast is cutting 236 jobs and 290 student places due to a funding reduction.
1,34218673,"Reports that Mr Hill, a former RAF pilot from Sandon, near Buntingford in Hertfordshire, had left hospital have not been confirmed by police. Sussex Police have also finished their work at the scene, but their investigations are continuing. Eleven people were killed when a vintage Hawker Hunter jet crashed into traffic on the A27 on 22 August. West Sussex chief fire officer Sean Ruth said the recovery operation was ""extremely challenging"" for crews. ""In my 27 years of service I have never experienced such an outpouring of gratitude and respect as I have received on behalf of West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service over the last few weeks - from letters and emails, to words of thanks in the street, and from visitors at a number of our local fire stations,"" he said. He anticipated that Friday would be the last day his crews worked at the scene and wanted to thank people for the ""over-whelming support we have received"". ""We have now finished work on the A27, however our investigation continues."" An initial AAIB report said Mr Hill was thrown clear of the aircraft during the later part of the crash, but it is not clear whether he initiated his ejection. Mr Ruth said the fire service had been ""truly humbled"" by the messages of support it had received. West Sussex County Council said the single closed westbound lane of the A27 was expected to be reopened to traffic next week but screens will stay up on the roadside indefinitely for reclamation work on the land to be completed. On Thursday, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it wanted to interview 51-year-old pilot Andy Hill as soon as possible. ""The thoughts and prayers of everyone at West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service continue to be with the families and friends of those killed and injured in the Shoreham Air Show tragedy,"" he said. After the crash, the pilot's family issued a statement which said they were devastated and deeply saddened by the loss of life and sent prayers and heartfelt condolences to the families of all those affected. Det Chief Insp Carwyn Hughes, of Sussex Police, said: ""Our officers and staff have been meticulous and have worked hard over the past three weeks to find answers for the victims' families.",Fire crews are expected to leave the site of the Shoreham Airshow disaster later after spending nearly three weeks at the scene of the crash.

The firm's strong performance sets it apart from European rivals H&M and Next, which have blamed unseasonal weather for below-forecast results this year. ""And while Zara is available in many of the territories in which they operate [online], most of their other brands aren't readily available outside Europe online.

This will encompass online apps for all of its brands and a specific app for the whole group called InWallet. That country's clothing market grew at an average of 3% in the three-months to the end of July, according to the Spanish statistics agency.

""So there is a big opportunity there for them to expand online into new territories."" ""I expect over the years they may find they don't have to open as many stores to maintain their strong growth rate as the online channel will become increasingly important,"" he said. Sales jumped from €9.4bn to €10.5bn, an increase of 11%. It also launched mobile phone payment in all its Spanish stores, with the objective of ""extending the service to other countries"". The world's biggest clothing retailer posted net earnings of €1.26bn (£1.1bn) in the six months to 31 July - up 8% on the same period last year.

Listening to the things we're going to do to change that, if people come down from now they will find a very different experience. Diamond also confirmed they are close to signing a new full-back and are still looking for another player to add to their backline, with former Bath and London Welsh winger Nick Scott on trial with the club. However, Cotton insists there will be no conflict of interest with a member of the coaching staff also working as a director.

5,36369346,"A spokesman for the employers anticipated only ""minor impact and minimal student disruption"". The University and College Union says the 1.1% rise offered by the universities is ""an insult"". The employers say the offer is ""at, and, for some, beyond, a limit of affordability for higher education institutions and the very best offer that will be available this year"". UCU says its members have suffered a real-terms pay cut of 14.% since 2009 and complains the squeeze on staff salaries has come as university leaders enjoyed hefty increases. Ballots of university support staff represented by Unison and Unite are also under way on the improved offer, with both unions recommending it be rejected. UCU is planning strike rallies in:
Staff are also working to contract from Wednesday - refusing to set extra work, cover for absent colleagues or work overtime. ""Industrial action which impacts on students is never taken lightly, but members feel that they have been left with no alternative. They say they have also offered talks on zero-hours contracts and on improving lower pay for female academics. ""If the employers wish to see a swift end to this dispute, and avoid further disruption, they need to come back to the table with a much-improved offer."" Unions representing university support staff are balloting on the offer, with strike action possible in the autumn. ""Even for examinations which are still taking place at some higher education institutions, more than nine out of 10 report that a no to low impact is anticipated,"" said the spokesman. But UCU says it rejected the 1.1% offer as it was only a marginal improvement on the original 1% on which it had balloted members. ""A 1.1% pay offer is an insult to hardworking staff, especially in light of the 5% pay rise vice-chancellors have enjoyed while holding down staff pay,"" said general secretary Sally Hunt. Summer exams are still running at some universities, though many have finished. ""We would like to see the UCU consulting its members on the final offer."" They maintain the weighting of the offer means the worst paid university staff will get a rise of more than 5%. But the Universities and Colleges Employers Association said the walkout was ""disappointing given the very good pay offer"".

6,40255148,"The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP is backing calls from Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson for Theresa May to adopt a more flexible approach that achieves a consensus across parties. But he played down differences with the Welsh Government over Brexit. But Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MP Simon Hart echoed Mr Crabb's call for cross-party consensus. These are one and the same things,"" he said. He said he did not buy the idea that because Theresa May has had ""an unquestionably difficult time for which she takes some of the blame"" it means ""it's game over"". Mr Cairns said it would be ""completely wrong"" to remain in the EU's single market as both major UK parties told voters they wanted to leave. ""Even the Labour Party don't want to remain part of the single market so it would be completely wrong to stay in the single market when the two largest parties are opposed to that."" Mr Crabb told BBC Wales: ""The majority of business opinion in Wales and the UK supports Britain staying in the single market and staying in the customs union but still coming out of the European Union legally. ""It is seven times more important now because of the result of the election that the devolved countries have a real voice in the process of leaving the European Union,"" he said. Mr Cairns, newly re-appointed to his role, said he wanted Brexit negotiations, due to start next week, to focus on the right outcome with businesses trading freely. ""And I think that argument needs to get looked at far more closely and if we can't achieve a satisfactory deal based on membership of the single market we need something that is pretty close to it if it's going to achieve the consensus that it needs to across the parties."" Mr Cairns's predecessor, Stephen Crabb, claimed the election had changed the terms of the Brexit debate. ""We've talked about frictionless trade, the Welsh Government have talked about unfettered access. Wales Office Minister Guto Bebb said the process of listening to devolved governments had begun.

7,40668749,"Guns account for less than 1% of items sold on the platform, with its main trade being in narcotics. ""The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities."" Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net. Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: ""In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal. Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: ""Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of $80,000 (Â£62,000). The study involved collecting data from 12 dark net marketplaces during a week in September 2016. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for ""lone-wolf"" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Nevertheless, the volume being sold ""can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies"", said the report. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous. Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. ""The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect."" The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold.","Criminals and terrorists are using the so-called dark net to buy weapons, a new study has suggested."

Last month, Surrey Police revealed Bellfield had made the admission during an investigation into whether he had an accomplice involved in the abduction and rape, but not murder, of Milly. Ms Cooper said Bellfield contacted her very soon after Surrey Police distributed its press statement relating to the Dowler case. Milly's body was found 25 miles away from where she was kidnapped, in Yateley Heath, Hampshire. Ms Cooper said Bellfield, now known as Yusuf Rahim, believed a ""covert tape"" may have been used to record his response to a police interview in prison. A police source speaking to the BBC would not comment on how the admission was recorded. Surrey Police confirmed it had received a letter from Bellfield's solicitors but said it was standing by its statement on the confession. He was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and Marsha McDonnell, 19, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, when he went on trial accused of killing Milly. He lived 50 yards from where Milly vanished but did not become a suspect until he was arrested by police in London for the other crimes in 2004. She said Bellfield denies all the crimes for which he has been convicted. On Wednesday, the Dowler family revealed harrowing details of Milly's final hours, saying they had been made aware of her suffering last year after Bellfield had spoken to police. Milly was kidnapped while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. She has written to Surrey Police requesting the tape recording and notes from the meeting. The force said it stood by its original statement.","Serial killer Levi Bellfield has denied confessing to the abduction, rape and killing of 13-year-old Milly Dowler."

""This could give us a new way to treat Staph infections that can be deadly, and might be used in combination with current antibiotics. The study, in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, could lead to a ""major change in treatment"", a UK expert said. US experts found B3, also known as nicotinamide, boosts the ability of immune cells to kill Staphylococcus bacteria. And the researchers say there is as yet no evidence that dietary B3 or supplements could prevent or treat bacterial infections. Prof Adrian Gombart, of Oregon State University's Linus Pauling Institute, who worked on the research, said: ""This is potentially very significant, although we still need to do human studies. B3 was tested on Staphylococcal infections, such as the potentially fatal MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). ""It's a way to tap into the power of the innate immune system and stimulate it to provide a more powerful and natural immune response."" ""This could cause a major change in treatment for infections alongside conventional antibiotics to help bolster patients immune system. The scientists used extremely high doses of B3 - far higher than that obtained from dietary sources - in their tests, carried out both on animals and on human blood. The researchers say B3 appears to be able to ""turn on"" certain antimicrobial genes, boosting the immune cells' killing power. ""Antibiotics are wonder drugs, but they face increasing problems with resistance by various types of bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus. Prof Mark Enright, of the University of Bath, said: ""Neutrophils  are really the front line against infections in the blood and the use of nicotinamide seems safe at this dose to use in patients as it is already licensed for use. B3 increases the numbers and efficacy of neutrophils, white blood cells that can kill and eat harmful bugs. Such infections are found in hospitals and nursing homes, but are also on the rise in prisons, the military and among athletes.","Vitamin B3 could be the new weapon in the fight against superbugs such as MRSA, researchers have suggested."

""I can think of youngsters, even at the highest-performing schools, who will find it a problem and who would have been better suited to do English, maths and science and a range of vocational subjects,"" he told the magazine. Sir Michael told the TES he agreed more young people should be studying these subjects - but said the combination was not suitable for everyone. Both policies will be subject to a government consultation later in the autumn. In addition, the Conservative manifesto pledges that schools which do not have 100% of pupils studying this set of subjects at GCSE should not be able to obtain Ofsted's top rating of ""outstanding"".

However, Israel's foreign ministry said the new units did not constitute a ""new settlement"". State department spokesman Mark Toner said the new settlement would be ""another step towards cementing a reality of perpetual occupation"" that would ""further call into question Israel's commitment to achieving a negotiated peace"".

In July, world powers warned of ""perpetual occupation and conflict"" between Israelis and Palestinians. Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) secretary general Saeb Erekat said while Palestinians welcomed Washington's criticism, they expected it ""to take real action"".

The three children were placed in foster care after the couple's arrest by counter-terrorism officers in 2015.

The raids came a day after it emerged a Frenchman was being held by police investigating the murder of three people at the Brussels Jewish Museum. They were an Israeli couple in their 50s, and a French female volunteer. Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, was arrested at a station in Marseille on Friday. A Belgian man, believed to be an employee of the museum, was critically injured. Speaking on French radio station RTL on Monday, the head of French Jewish association CRIF, Roger Cukierman, called for more resources to be given to the foreign intelligence service, the DGSE, to track militants returning to France from Syria. He was also said to have had a white sheet emblazoned with the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, a jihadist group fighting in Syria, and a camera with a 40-second video showing the two guns and a voice recording, claiming responsibility for the killings.

In 2012 it lost its position as the world's leading supplier of PCs to Lenovo. Its fortunes started to decline with a series of expensive and much criticised acquisitions including Compaq for $25bn in 2002, consultants EDS for $14bn in 2008 and Autonomy for $11bn in 2011. It follows 55,000 job cuts announced earlier this year. ""I'm frankly not sure if HP is finished with the layoffs."" ""The number is sadly larger than some people might have expected, but I think it's a reflection of how much trouble HP has been having with its services,"" said Charles King, analyst at the Silicon Valley IT consulting firm Pund-IT. The new structure proposed by Ms Whitman sees HP Enterprise focusing primarily on businesses and government agencies, and the PC and printing divisions on the consumer market. However, Hewlett-Packard is still one of the world's largest technology companies, with revenues this year expected to top $50bn. The share price peaked at the height of the dot.com boom in 2000, and, despite two surges in 2007 and 2010, it has lost some 60% of its value since then. The tech company has struggled over the last decade to keep up with changing demands as customers move away from desktop computers. The company famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and grew to be the guiding light of what became known as Silicon Valley. The losses will come in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which is splitting from the printer and PC business. At a meeting for Wall Street analysts, chairman and chief executive Meg Whitman said: ""We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring."" The company will not say where the cuts will fall, but part of the plan involves changing the nature of the workforce. The proportion of workers in what HPE calls ""low-cost locations"" is expected to rise from around 42% now to 60% by 2018.","Hewlett-Packard says it will cut another 25,000-30,000 jobs, or 10% of its workforce, as it plans to split the company in two."

Civil measures - including prohibition notices and prohibition orders - will also be possible. Commander Simon Bray, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: ""A blanket ban on new psychoactive substances will make it simpler for law enforcement to deal with those drugs which are potentially unsafe but which may not yet be controlled."" A blanket ban on legal highs, which are often sold online or on the high street, was in the Conservative Party's election manifesto and featured in the Queen's Speech. The Psychoactive Substances Bill applied to ""any substance intended for human consumption that is capable of producing a psychoactive effect"", the government said. Ministers said young people who took them were ""taking exceptional risks with their health"". Ministers are to publish draft laws they say are a ""landmark"" in prohibiting the substances' production, distribution, sale and supply. The government's proposals would apply throughout the United Kingdom, and would include powers to seize and destroy legal highs and to search people, premises and vehicles. Alcohol, tobacco and caffeine will be excluded, and there are also exemptions for food and medical products, while controlled drugs will continue to be regulated by existing laws. Labour also promised to ban their sale and distribution in its manifesto. Home Office minister Mike Penning said the measures would ""fundamentally change the way we tackle new psychoactive substances"". The government said the ""legitimate sale"" of nitrous oxide, which is also used for food processing, medicinal and industrial purposes, would not be affected. The new restrictions will also extend to the sale of nitrous oxide - also known as laughing gas or ""hippy crack"" - for human use. Legal highs are not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act, although individual substances, such as mephedrone, have been outlawed. He added: ""The blanket ban will give police and other law enforcement agencies greater powers to tackle the reckless trade in psychoactive substances, instead of having to take a substance-by-substance approach."" Legal highs, officially called new psychoactive substances, have been linked to a number of deaths. What are legal highs?","A new ""blanket ban"" on so-called legal highs will carry prison sentences of up to seven years, the government says."

Mrs Sterling burst into tears as the ruling was delivered after the nine-day hearing, saying: ""I can't believe it's over. The racism allegations had led the NBA to fine Mr Sterling $2.5m. In a 10-minute audio recording published on celebrity website TMZ in April, Mr Sterling was heard telling a woman, subsequently identified as his girlfriend V Stiviano, not to associate in public with black people nor bring them to Clippers games. Judge Michael Levanas said the $2bn sale could go ahead. Mrs Sterling had told her husband to seek an evaluation by two doctors in May. Mr Sterling, 80, had been contesting his estranged wife Shelly's decision to sell the basketball team franchise to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. He said that Mrs Sterling ""had every good reason to believe that Donald agreed to the sale of the team"". ""We look forward to the transaction closing as soon as possible,"" it said. I feel good."" The ruling would take effect in the coming weeks, the judge said. This in effect handed Mrs Sterling control of the Clippers. It had also said it wanted to force Mr Sterling to sell the team. Mr Sterling was banned from basketball for life after he was recorded making racist remarks in April. Mr Sterling is suing the NBA, alleging it violated his constitutional rights by relying on information from an ""illegal"" recording. In a statement, the National Basketball Association (NBA) said it was ""pleased"" by the ruling. The doctors declared him ""mentally incapacitated"" and unfit to administer his duties as trustee of the Sterling Family Trust. Mr Sterling had originally agreed to the sale of the basketball team, but then revoked his blessing, saying he had been improperly removed from the trust. The remarks drew widespread condemnation from fans, retired basketball stars and President Barack Obama. The Los Angeles court case focused on allegations that Mrs Sterling used medical tests of her husband's mental capacity to remove him as a member of the trust that owned the team, and deceived him into selling.","A US judge has ruled that the LA Clippers basketball team can be sold, despite the objections of banned co-owner Donald Sterling."
35,40260319,"""Ecologists understand why some groups of species are declining more, such as why farmland species are declining more than woodland species,"" said Dr Andrew Higginson of the University of Exeter. Research suggest animals that build their nests in early spring may win the fight for available habitat at the expense of late breeders. Fighting over nest sites may be part of the reason - when nest sites are hard to come by, the species that will suffer most are those that nest later in the year."" Conservation efforts should focus on ensuring rare species have enough places to nest, say scientists. ""But an enduring mystery is the big variation in the declines of closely related species. ""We need to worry about the whole life cycle not just what they eat."" Restoration and provision of nest sites should be an urgent priority, he said. The research is published in the journal, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. For example, areas could be left to grow wild between spring and summer to help bumblebees establish nests. The University of Exeter study analysed population changes in more than 200 bird species and 40 bumblebee species around the world. This could be as simple as waiting to cut hedgerows until later in the year when all animals have nested or providing more boxes for birds to nest in. The population data was combined with a mathematical model that used game theory to predict the likely behaviour of bees and birds when faced with competition for nesting sites. Follow Helen on  Twitter. Habitats such as hedgerows and hay meadows are being lost in many countries, meaning that fewer nesting sites are available. Competition among animals for a suitable place to nest could explain why some species are struggling to survive. ""We need to have a more holistic approach to providing good habitat for animals,"" Dr Higginson told BBC News. He said conservation efforts for animals such as birds and bees tend to focus on providing food. The study found larger species that nest early generally do better, while smaller bees and birds that nest later in the year lose out in the struggle for habitat. For example, the chaffinch is doing well in the UK, while the goldfinch is on the decline. It calculated the implications of fighting for nesting sites, based on the size of each species, the time of nesting and the quality of the nesting site.",Competition for nesting sites could explain why some birds and bumblebees are declining faster than others.

France sees Britain and the City of London as adversaries, not partners."" ""The meeting with the French Central Bank was the worst I have had anywhere in the EU "" he wrote. Mr Browne suggested that France's adversarial tone was jarring with other EU member states, aiming for a more conciliatory approach. ""They are crystal clear about their underlying objective: the weakening of Britain, the ongoing degradation of the City of London."" Mr Browne a former Liberal Democrat minister and since 2015 the City's special representative to the EU, attended talks with various French authorities earlier this month.

Red Bull and Ferrari have been pushing to allow an extra stage of development in the summer. The agreement needs ratifying at a meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council, but F1's legislative body is expected to rubber stamp it. The BBC has learned that they abandoned plans to introduce standing re-starts following the deployment of the safety car but failed to come up with any formal proposals aimed at keeping costs under control. Mercedes are against the idea but have offered to accept a limited amount of development. Lewis Hamilton was 17 points ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg going into the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix but made sure of the title by winning at Yas Marina. It was introduced for the final race of 2014 to keep the championship alive for as long as possible but was criticised by drivers, teams and fans. The World Motor Sport Council, which meets in Qatar on 3 December, will also hear from the investigation into the accident at the Japanese Grand Prix that left Marussia driver Jules Bianchi with severe head injuries. Force India, Lotus and Sauber have also complained that they are struggling financially because the split of prize money is not equitable. There was also no agreement on allowing limited in-season engine development. The issue of costs remains a hot topic following the financial collapse of the Marussia and Caterham teams. As it turned out, the outcome of the 2014 championship would have rested on the final race even if double points had not been in force. Unanimous agreement is required to change the rules for next season. Currently, the rules allow a specified amount of development between seasons but none during the championship. The investigation was charged with establishing what happened and coming up with new measures to reinforce safety at circuits. Ecclestone and FIA president Jean Todt met with representatives of the teams, circuits and sponsors to discuss a number of proposals at this week's meeting, not just the double points rule.

The hospital was at the centre of a Â£6m public inquiry into care failings. But the trust was told it must address high waiting times in its emergency department, and inspectors noted the Royal Stoke had ""consistently and frequently failed the four-hour waiting time target"". The trust was rated as good overall for how caring its services were, but told it required improvement to ensure safe, effective and well-led services. It also said the trust should review capacity and adequacy of critical care services, and communication between senior management and frontline staff. They carried out unannounced inspections in May.

46,28226775,"The dispute arose after the assembly passed a law last year to set minimum wages, and the terms and conditions, of agricultural workers in Wales after the UK government abolished the Agricultural Wages Board, which had regulated the sector. UK Attorney General Dominic Grieve originally blocked a law passed by AMs last year, saying it was not within the assembly's powers. David Jones said UK ministers would ""continue to make every effort to ensure that the legislative arrangements for Welsh devolution work effectively."" Liberal Democrat Eluned Parrott agreed Wales should move to a form of devolution more like the Scottish system that had received ""no legal challenges at all to Scottish legislation"" since 1999. UK ministers said they were grateful for clarity on the issue. ""In its judgment, the court has favoured a broader interpretation of the provisions in the Government of Wales Act that govern the assembly's competence,"" he said. On Wednesday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said the ""significant"" Supreme Court judgment ""goes some way to clarifying the complexities of the current devolution settlement"". Welsh Secretary David Jones said UK ministers were ""grateful to the Supreme Court for providing clarity on this issue"" and they would ""study the judgment in detail and consider its implications"". He called for Wales to move to a form of devolution where powers are assumed to rest with the assembly in cases like this, unless legislation specifically rules this out. It comes after a dispute over whether Wales had the power to set minimum wages, or if that right laid with the UK government. The Welsh government said it could now create an Agricultural Advisory Panel to set minimum wage levels and ""promote skills development and career progression"" in farming. But the first minister warned ""we cannot continue to have bill after bill"" referred to the Supreme Court ""with all the time, cost and uncertainty that involves"". Assembly Shadow Rural Affairs Minister Russell George blamed ""rushed"" legislation for much of the confusion over the agricultural bill producing ""sloppy law-making, doubts over competence, and months of uncertainty for Welsh farmers"". Plaid Cymru agriculture spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said: ""The case for moving to a reserved powers model has been made and has been accepted by all parties in the assembly, and adopting this model would avoid these unnecessary delays.""","Welsh ministers can protect the wages of 13,000 farm workers, in light of a ruling by the Supreme Court."
47,31529663,"Ms Yingluck was not at Bangkok's Supreme Court to hear the indictment. The anti-corruption agency has also called for her to be personally liable for losses to state coffers. The Shinawatra family are hugely popular among Thailand's rural population but are hated by the urban middle-class and elite who accuse them of corruption. She was later impeached over the rice subsidy scheme and banned from politics for five years. If found guilty on the charge of negligence, she could be jailed for up to 10 years. But Thailand has been embroiled in a cycle of political instability since the military ousted Ms Yingluck's brother, billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, as prime minister in 2006. The Supreme Court will decide on 19 March whether to pursue the criminal case. The military seized power in May 2014 in what it said was a bid to restore public order after months of occasionally violent street protests against Ms Yingluck's government. Thailand, meanwhile, remains under martial law in the wake of the coup. She said the policy was aimed at helping farmers and denied any day-to-day involvement in the running of the scheme. Ms Yingluck was removed by a court in May 2014, shortly before the military ousted her elected government. Additionally, Finance Minister Sommai Phasee said on Wednesday that the ministry had received a letter from the national corruption watchdog urging it to pursue civil suit against Ms Yingluck to recover losses of 600bn baht ($18.4bn; Â£11.9bn) related to the scheme. But the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says today's court filing will seem to her supporters like yet another attempt by the military to crush her politically for whenever Thailand does return to democratic rule. Thaksin-linked parties, under various different names, have won every election since 2001. ""The finance ministry oversees damages to the state and is ready to take action,"" he said. Critics accused Ms Yingluck of funnelling money to her core supporters. Under the rice subsidy scheme Ms Yingluck's Pheu Thai-led government bought rice from Thai farmers at above the market rate, costing the government billions of dollars.",Thailand's attorney-general has filed criminal charges against former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra over a controversial rice subsidy scheme.

Britain's last world title was secured by Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson, while Chris Adcock partnered Imogen Bankier to world silver in 2011. ""Obviously it's been a lot harder and an emotional time when people have been losing their jobs, or unable to train but on court we've channelled that into working even harder,"" Chris Adcock told BBC Sport. As a result, half of the English players and support staff had to be cut from the programme in Milton Keynes.

The Adcocks as well as Ellis and Langridge and Scottish Commonwealth silver medallist Kirsty Gilmour have received first-round byes at the World Championships and begin their campaigns on Tuesday. The Adcocks, who married in 2013, remain part of a 12-strong group of English players looking to challenge for honours and despite their struggles off the court the pair claimed silver at the World Superseries Finals in Dubai and became European champions for the first time in April.

It is not clear when the air strikes took place or which militant group was targeted, the BBC's Shahzeb Jillani in Islamabad reports. The brazen attack has brought the government of the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, under renewed pressure to order tough action against the Taliban militants, says the BBC's Shahzeb Jillani. The raids destroyed nine militant positions in the Tirah Valley in Khyber district, the military said. The Pakistani Taliban said Sunday's assault was in revenge for the killing of their leader last year. The Khyber tribal region, near the Pakistan-Afghan border, is believed to be a base for several militant groups and foreign fighters. The strikes came after the Taliban stormed Karachi airport, in an attack that killed at least 30 people. Officials said they were charred beyond recognition. On Tuesday, officials said nine more bodies had been recovered from the airport. Pakistan has been fighting an Islamist insurgency for more than a decade, with the Pakistani Taliban the main militant grouping. Security forces gained control in the early hours of Monday. The airport reopened late on Monday. The number included seven bodies found in the airport's cold storage facility.

A year earlier, it was alleged the number of migrants said to be living at the centre had been greatly over exaggerated, while in 2013 a health inspection found asylum seekers were being fed small portions of out-of-date food. Another of those arrested was Leonardo Sacco, head of the Catholic Misericordia association that is supposed to control the Sant'Anna Cara immigrant centre. According to Rosy Bindi, the head of parliament's anti-mafia commission, the centre had effectively been transformed into ""a money printing operation for organised crime"". The arrests come two years after L'Espresso magazine published an investigation, alleging funds were being stolen and managers were making money by starving the migrants who lived there.

Pakistan said he told the court he had been ordered to ""plan, coordinate, and organise espionage/sabotage activities aiming to destabilise and wage war against Pakistan"". It later leaked to the press the names and photos of eight alleged Indian spies working from India's mission in Islamabad. Shortly after his arrest, Islamabad released a video in which he was shown admitting involvement in spying. Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said Kulbhushan Jadhav was ""kidnapped"" and tried on ""concocted charges"". Sarabjit Singh, an Indian man sentenced to death for spying in 1991, died in prison in 2013 while on death row after an attack by other prisoners. But executions for spying are rare. Home Minister Rajnath Singh promised that the government would do ""whatever it takes to make sure Mr Jadhav gets justice"". In November, Pakistan withdrew six officials from its mission in Delhi after they were outed as suspected spies by India. India has always questioned the alleged confession, saying that it was extracted under duress. There are differing accounts of how and where Kulbhushan Jadhav was detained. India says he was kidnapped by Pakistan while he was in Iran. He has 40 days to appeal to the court, Pakistani media report. In 1999, Pakistan hanged Sheikh Shamim 10 years after his conviction for spying. No date was given for his execution. Speaking in the Indian parliament on Tuesday, Ms Swaraj described the death sentence as ""an indefensible verdict"" and warned Pakistan to ""consider the consequences"".","India says it will do ""whatever it takes"" to ensure justice for a former navy officer sentenced to death in Pakistan on charges of spying."

The people were ""resolutely refusing to leave the streets"", the report said. Mike Hallet, who has been homeless for two years, also denied it was a choice. He said the way to address homelessness is to supply individual support for as long as is needed.

An investigation by Northampton Borough Council discovered 21 homeless people in the town, including ""a significant proportion of European migrants"". Council officials held talks with 30 organisations to develop a plan to eliminate rough sleeping by June 2017. He said it was not a lifestyle choice for him and he would like nothing more than to have a home. But Darren Jordan, who lived on the streets for two months before finding space in a homeless shelter, believes ""some people get stuck in a rut and then it does become a lifestyle choice"".

Spending on the NHS should also be paid for by a dedicated tax marked on every payslip, the former health minister suggested. ""The bottom line is with rising demand because of an ageing population we need more investment,"" he said. But Mr Lamb told the BBC that this was insufficient and, having ""seen the books"" as a minister in the last government, he feared the NHS could face a funding shortfall of £30bn by 2020. He intends to consult health bodies and professionals, patients, trade unions and academics. Under Mr Lamb's plan, taxes would not be increased as the new levy would be offset by deductions to income tax or national insurance. ""I've been in the department. If we carry on regardless, the system will crash."" But Mr Lamb, the party's health spokesman, told party members he was ""very interested in the idea of a dedicated NHS and care contribution - separating it out from the rest of taxation, clearly identified on your payslip. Mr Lamb also warned that the social care system was ""on its knees"" and could collapse without a cash injection of £5bn. The plans are not yet party policy and will not be put to this year's conference in Bournemouth. I have seen the books and I am deeply concerned. Ministers have pledged £2bn in this financial year for the NHS, and an extra £8bn by 2020. An attempt to establish a cross-party commission on social care before the 2010 election - led in part by Mr Lamb - collapsed in acrimony. The Lib Dems say he would like to implement the ideas across the UK, although, as health and social care are devolved, it is unclear how this would be enforced. Mr Lamb - who lost out to Tim Farron in a leadership election in July - proposes a cross-party commission to explore the ideas. ""And I am really interested in the idea of the right for local areas to raise additional funds for the NHS and care if they choose."" He has warned the NHS faces collapse without an urgent cash injection.","English councils should be allowed to put up taxes to fund the NHS, Norman Lamb has told the Lib Dem conference."

""This judgment will hopefully now secure the best possible treatment and care for him."" The club regretted a former employee had been remiss in their duties. In a screening prior to signing for the club, an electrocardiogram test showed his heart was ""unequivocally abnormal"" but he was not stopped from playing. The teenager collapsed during the game against Cercle Bruges on 4 August 2006 and was rushed to an intensive care unit but suffered oxygen starvation to his brain. ""The club did not tell us or Radwan about his potentially fatal condition. Mr Hamed's MRI scan showed no obvious signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but Dr Mills wrote to Spurs saying the condition could not be excluded on these findings alone. ""Just as Radwan had no choice but to start his difficult journey towards recovery, we had no choice but to start the difficult journey to obtain justice,"" they said. Football Association rules require all football academy recruits to be referred to a cardiologist to help identify those prone to potentially fatal heart conditions. Radwan Hamed collapsed during a game in Belgium in 2006. ""We risked losing our home and faced personal financial ruin in order to pursue justice for our son. Eleven months later, the teenager, who was unaware his tests had revealed an ""abnormal"" heart condition, signed a contract with Spurs. In the 2015 hearing, Mr Justice Hickinbottom ruled the club was 70% liable or Mr Hamed's injuries and Dr Peter Mills, the Football Association's regional cardiologist for South East England, was 30% liable. Had they done so, Radwan would not have continued to play football."" In a statement, the family of Mr Hamed, who is now 27, said they were ""relieved"" a settlement had been reached, following a decade-long legal battle .

It claimed that golfers walking 18 holes could cover four to eight miles, while those using an electric golf cart typically chalked up four miles. ""This project is something we can all get behind, as it is universally agreed that golf is good for you,"" he said.

67,36206936,"It emerged on Wednesday that emergency calls were made from the Paisley Park complex 46 times in the past five years. Mr Mauzy said the plan was to stabilise him in Minnesota, before flying him to California to seek treatment at Dr Kornfeld's Recovery Without Walls rehab centre in Mill Valley. Unable to make it to Minnesota, the doctor dispatched his son and called a local doctor, who cleared his morning schedule but never saw the singer. The law offers some legal protections to those who make emergency calls, to encourage them to do so. When Andrew Kornfeld, who works with his father but is not a doctor, arrived at Prince's Paisley Park home, he was told that the singer was missing. In a strange turn of events, it was his son, Andrew Kornfeld, who called police after joining Prince's staff to search for the missing singer. They are also trying to establish whether a doctor was on the singer's plane when it made an emergency landing less than a week before he died. William Mauzy told reporters on Wednesday that Prince's team contacted Dr Howard Kornfeld on 20 April, the day before Prince died. The lawyer confirmed that Andrew Kornfeld had been interviewed by police, but was protected by Minnesota's Good Samaritan law. The Kornfelds' lawyer said neither had met Prince before his death. He joined members of staff to search the property and made the emergency call when Prince's unresponsive body was found. The specialist, Dr Howard Kornfeld, was unable to make it from California to Minnesota immediately but sent his son. Detectives investigating his death have asked to see fire and ambulance records related to the emergency landing. The musician was found unconscious on the plane after it stopped in Moline, Illinois, on 15 April. A log released by Minnesota authorities showed the 911 calls related to everything from medical emergencies to false fire alarms. No details have been released from Prince's autopsy exam, but investigators are looking into whether he died from an overdose and if a doctor was prescribing him drugs in the weeks before his death. It included one call in 2011 in which an unidentified woman said she was concerned about Prince's cocaine use, but no police action was taken.","Prince's team requested emergency support from a leading addiction specialist just a day before the singer died, the doctor's lawyer has revealed."
68,35706703,"TfL said more police have been deployed in accident hotspots and it is focusing on motorcycle and scooter safety. Researchers spoke to 1,200 riders and found one in five had been involved in a collision and about 62% motorcyclists had been involved in a near-miss incident. Valerie Shawcross, chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee, said: ""Arguably motorcyclists have been overlooked in public discussion about road safety in recent years. The report also called on authorities to educate young riders. In 2014, 27 motorcyclists were killed and the number of serious injuries also rose from 507 to 514 in the year up to September 2015. Leon Daniels, TfL's managing director of surface transport, said: ""On-street education and enforcement, substantial investment in improving rider skills and guidance to help engineers design roads so that they are safer for riders, all form part of a concerted effort to improve road safety in the capital."" Police will also target the boroughs where motorcyclists are at greatest risk of injury. ""However, 36 motorcyclists were killed on London's roads last year, a death toll that is unacceptably high, and part of a bigger picture of collisions and injuries affecting motorcyclists, many of them life-changing in their seriousness."" TfL said that since September police had stopped 5,389 riders, issued 742 traffic offence reports, 1,335 verbal warnings, seized 96 motorcycles and made 10 arrests. London Assembly's Transport Committee said the figure for deaths was ""unacceptably high"". It also asked TfL to monitor the impact of dedicated Cycle Superhighways on the road space shared by other traffic. The figures were released as the London Assembly committee published its report â€˜Easy Rider: Improving motorcycle safety on London roadsâ€™. The report found the inconsistency over access to bus lanes causes ""unnecessary confusion"" as TfL allows motorcyclists to ride in bus lanes on the roads it manages, while many boroughs do not. In 2010, 4,337 motorcyclists were injured in London, which by 2014 rose to 5,233, an increase of nearly 21%.","The number of motorcyclists killed on London's roads reached 36 in 2015, Transport for London (TfL) data showed."

He said he was ""ashamed"" of deriving sexual gratification from child pornography and now understood there were ""real victims"". He and co-accused Matthew Stansfield, 34, deny conspiracy to rape a child. The court has heard how members of a gang raped and abused young children, live streaming the attacks over the internet. The men contacted each other using Skype, video conferencing software and online chatrooms. Mr Denham, from Wiltshire, has pleaded guilty to child pornography offences and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity in the presence of a child. They also deny conspiracy to sexually assault a child under the age of 13. He said he became ""desensitised"" to what he was seeing on screen and the age range ""dropped lower and lower"". But he admitted that months afterwards he had watched a video showing Hollyson raping the child. Former actor John Denham, 49, said conversations he had had about it were ""fantasy"" and he did not think ""any of that stuff"" would happen. The court heard that the alleged plan to rape a baby was to have taken place on 17 January last year in Bedfordshire. The trial continues. Mr Stansfield, from Hampshire, has pleaded guilty to child pornography offences. ""It wasn't reality for me at the time,"" he said. Mr Denham, who has two children and was previously known as Benjamin Harrop, said in court he did not believe the intended victim existed. Mr Denham said he had begun by viewing adult pornography online but after seeing an image of a young teenage girl performing a sex act on a man he became ""oddly fascinated"" by child pornography.

Chisako Kakehi was arrested in 2014 and went on trial in Kyoto late last month. Prosecutors say Ms Kakehi targeted the men for their money and poisoned them all with cyanide. The 70-year-old said she committed the crime because her husband was not treating her well financially, and that she obtained the cyanide from a business associate. Japanese press have dubbed Ms Kakehi a ""black widow"" - a term derived from the female spider that eats its partner after mating.

Police guarded the entrances to schools in the Montevrain area in case the cat turned up, as a helicopter with thermal imaging hovered. Sightings of the animal sparked a search involving hundreds of emergency services workers, animal-trackers and a helicopter. There was a fresh alert on Friday morning after paw prints were discovered near a service station east of Paris. The hunt has focused on areas near the Disneyland Paris theme park. Le Parisien newspaper said several local residents had sighted the animal. But experts now say the animal is most likely a much less dangerous animal, such as a lynx or large domestic cat. It remains unclear where the animal came from, though there is a big cat park near Montevrain. It was first spotted at Montevrain, 38km (23 miles) east of Paris. The woman took a photograph that appears to show a large cat. ""She didn't get out of the car and called me to say 'I think I saw a lynx',"" he was quoted as saying. A source told AFP that the search had been scaled back for the moment and the helicopter grounded, although forces remained ""mobilised"" in case of a fresh alert. The Montevrain mayor's office dismissed the idea that the big cat could have escaped from a circus that was in the town until Saturday, Le Parisien reported. A dozen or so soldiers from a nearby army base joined police and fire officials combing the countryside outside Montevrain. They made their conclusions based on inspecting animal tracks. Local residents were asked to stay indoors and parents urged to take their children to and from school by car.

78,16055896,"""The UK government needs to listen to the many voices in Scotland who clearly want to see full devolution of the policy on APD."" Commenting on the UK Government's decision not to grant the Scottish government similar powers for now, Jim O'Sullivan, managing director of Edinburgh Airport, said: ""APD is already costing Scotland passengers and having an impact on tourism revenues. Scottish Transport Minister, Keith Brown said the case for devolving APD was ""compelling"" and had been backed by all four of Scotland's biggest airports, and recommended by the Calman Commission. A report published following a consultation on reform of APD said the government at Westminster would ""continue to explore the feasibility and likely effects of devolution to Scotland and Wales"". That prompted calls from Scottish and Welsh airports for similar treatment. ""We would urge the Westminster Government to see Scotland as it does Northern Ireland and understand the need to both reduce and devolve this unfair and damaging tax."" Earlier this year Chancellor George Osborne announced the duty would be cut for direct long-haul routes from Northern Ireland airports, and he would devolve control over the tax to the Northern Irish Assembly. The move came in response to fears that some routes could be scrapped due to competition from Irish airports where APD is much lower. He added: ""We need to be able to deal with the competitive and connectivity disadvantages that Scotland faces and if APD were devolved now we could provide the means to incentivise airlines to provide new direct international connections to Scotland, benefiting our aviation industry and our passengers and supporting the growth of the Scottish economy. Amanda McMillan, managing director of Glasgow Airport, said: ""On the question of devolution of APD, Glasgow Airport has always been supportive of this proposal given the Scottish government's more progressive approach to aviation and its greater appreciation of the role the industry plays in supporting the growth of the Scottish economy."" The UK government gave Northern Ireland the power to reduce the level of the tax because it said it had a special economic case. ""We know from discussions with our airline partners that it is a major factor in their decision to connect further routes to Scotland. The UK Treasury said it had not ruled out devolving APD to Scotland and Wales in the future.",Scottish airport operators have said they are dismayed and disappointed that the control of air passenger duty (APD) will not be devolved to Scotland.

Shortly after the murder, police released CCTV images showing the victim shopping in the off-licence in a bid to get witnesses to come forward. The last public sighting of Mr McAfee was in an off-licence on the Cavehill Road, close to his home, on the afternoon of Thursday 19 December 2013. The 50-year-old had been stabbed a number of times and sustained head wounds consistent with being hit with an axe. Police said he ""suffered a violent death"" and added that they believed his killer used an axe and a large knife. They said that although it was not a random attack, his killer remains a danger to others in the community. Mr McAfee, a father-of-two, was attacked in the living room of his home and police have released a photograph of the murder scene as part of the renewed appeal. Anyone with information about the case is asked to contact police on the non-emergency number 101. ""He suffered a violent death at the hands of an assailant who was probably wielding an axe and a long-bladed knife,"" Mr McVea said. ""But it remains an enduring heartache for his family - his mother, siblings and his grown-up children. The investigating officer described the murder as a ""ferocious attack"".

80,35773812,"Shares in Home Retail closed down almost 0.5% at 179.1p, but have risen more than 80% this year following Sainsbury's interest in Argos. Both companies have until 18 March to make firm bids for Argos. The electrical and homeware retailer is being targeted by both Sainsbury's and South African retailer Steinhoff. The new openings held back the like-for-like sales total over the period, it added. Sainsbury's had offered about 167p a share for Home Retail, but will be forced to at least match the 175p-a-share all-cash offer from Steinhoff, which owns UK furniture retailer Harveys. Last month, a £1.3bn bid from Sainsbury's for Home Retail was trumped by Steinhoff's £1.4bn offer. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: ""Home Retail claim that underlying like-for-like sales were broadly flat, once the cannibalisation from the infamous concession inserts in Homebase and Sainsbury are taken out. Home Retail recently sold its DIY chain Homebase to Australia's Wesfarmers last month for £340m, leaving Argos as its only remaining business. Total sales at Argos rose 1.9% to £515m in the eight-week period as demand for furniture and sports goods offset lower sales of electrical goods, such as video games and tablet computers. However, the supermarket may be reluctant to increase its offer to the level needed to win control of Argos. The company said Argos opened 90 new stores over the year, bringing the total to 845. Analysts have also questioned the wisdom of Sainsbury's acquiring the struggling retailer. Gross margins were up, however, by 75 basis points and Home Retail's year-end net cash was strong."" Chief executive John Walden, who said it had been ""another rather eventful period"" for the company, was pleased with the improvement in Argos' sales. Home Retail Group said that like-for-like sales at Argos fell 1.1% in the eight weeks to 27 February, compared to a fall of 2.2% in the previous quarter. The supermarket has argued that combining both chains would create a ""world-leading"" retailer bigger than rivals John Lewis and Amazon UK.","Argos, the retail chain at the centre of a bidding war, has shown a fall in sales over the Christmas period."

She said: ""I am terrified of his actions. She split with him after she found out he had been messaging other women on the dating site Tinder, jurors were told. Alice Ruggles, 24, had told police she felt ""terrified"" of Trimaan Dhillon days before she was found with her throat cut in her Gateshead flat. During the relationship Mr Dhillon made Ms Ruggles feel self-conscious and hacked her Facebook account, jurors were told. I am being stalked and I want it to stop."" She said it was affecting her concentration and work, adding: ""I don't feel safe in my own home."" Ms Ruggles, who grew up in Leicestershire and stayed in Newcastle after studying at Northumbria University, made a police statement on 2 October in which she said he sounded ""crazy"" on voicemails, and described him as obsessed. The court has heard he continued to travel to her home late at night to leave flowers and left her a phone message in which he repeatedly said he did not want to kill her. Mr Dhillon, a lance corporal in the Army, denies murder. Ms Ruggles' sister Emma told Newcastle Crown Court that the 24-year-old felt police would not act. The sister, who is a British army officer, told Ms Ruggles to contact police amid concerns about Mr Dhillon harassing her, but Ms Ruggles replied she had and they would not respond until he had stabbed her. The court has heard Mr Dhillon was a serving soldier with the 2 Scots and lived in barracks outside Edinburgh. Ms Ruggles' mother Susan Hills said Mr Dhillon was polite but ""insincere"", and after the break-up he sent her a ""very creepy"" message asking her to help him reunite with her daughter. He was given official warnings by police and the Army to stay away from his ex-girlfriend, it was told.","A woman allegedly murdered by her ex-boyfriend said police would not respond to her fears about him until she had been stabbed, a court has heard."

It is now worth between 11-15% less against the euro and the dollar, making anything we buy with our weaker currency more expensive. As the consumer we have been the driver of the UK economic engine - and now you can hear it start to splutter,"" adds Mr Urquart-Stewart, co-founder of fund manager Seven Investment Management. The latest official figures showed wage growth behind inflation for the first time since mid-2014, and the Bank of England has said it expects this to get worse. Visa said physical stores saw sales drop at their fastest pace for over five years in May, with sales down 5.3% year-on-year. Its latest survey shows household spending dipped for the first time in four years last month with families ""starting to feel the squeeze"" as higher living costs eat into pay. One of the chief reasons for inflation's rise is the steep fall in sterling since the UK voted to leave the European Union. The findings chime with official data from the Office for National Statistics, which shows that wage growth is falling back while inflation is rising, causing a squeeze on household incomes as they  fail to keep pace with shop prices. In contrast, spending at hotels and restaurants rose at an annual rate of 3.3%. ""Our card's maxed out, nothing in the savings account, pockets emptied out and nothing down the back of the sofa."" ""Let's face it, we are skint,"" says commentator Justin Urquart-Stewart. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.1% in the three months to March, while inflation rose by 2.3% in the year to March 2017. But even though so-called ""experiences"" spending rose, the figures suggest people are still being careful. ""Now is starts to hurt, with inflation above lower pay levels we will all start to feel poorer. The Visa figures show overall spending was 08% lower than in 2016, the first fall since September 2013. That leaves shops with a dilemma, shred their often already paper-thin profit margins or raise prices.","We're buying fewer clothes and pairs of shoes, although we're eating out more, according to credit card firm Visa."

Various delegations had addressed the full meeting of Aberdeen City Council during the day. The vital vote focused on the proposed £140m plan - backed by £50m from businessman Sir Ian Wood - to transform the historic Union Terrace Gardens. Conservative Alan Donnelly said the amendment was an ""almighty fudge"". One of the first to speak among earlier delegations was Leo Koot, managing director of oil firm TAQA Bratani, who said Union Terrace Gardens was a ""dark hole"". However, Mike Shepherd, chairman of Friends of Union Terrace Gardens, said: ""There is no doubt that our councillors made the correct decision. ""Union Terrace Gardens is at the heart of our city. He said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" at the decision. Let's go ahead and do it."" The abstention was from Liberal Democrat Ian Yuill. Sir Ian's £50m offer has now been withdrawn. Prominent Aberdeen hotelier Stewart Spence said the city needed to attract tourists, and required more than a spruce up. New proposals from the Independent Alliance Group were backed by 22, with 20 against and one abstention. Callum McCaig, leader of SNP group, had called for the City Garden Project to be backed. Dan McCroskrie, speaking on behalf of the young people who support the scheme, said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity which would help attract more young people into the city.

85,34418595,"""I don't think Mr Mourinho comes well out of the whole saga - he clearly made a mistake in the heat of a game, and should have said so and apologised,"" said FA chairman Dyke. That meant Chelsea were reduced to nine men, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois having been sent off, and Mourinho criticised the pair in a post-match news conference. Carneiro and head physio Jon Fearn had treated Eden Hazard for an injury after being called onto the pitch by the referee, which meant the player had to leave the field. Rabbatts, head of the FA's inclusion advisory board, said the governing body's reaction had been ""seriously disappointing"". ""We have engaged an expert of high calibre to address such an important issue such as discriminatory language, which we take very seriously,"" said a spokesperson. The FA has been criticised by one of its board members - Heather Rabbatts - for its handling of the case. Carneiro, 42, had her role downgraded before deciding to leave the club. But the FA said it had appointed an independent academic expert in Portuguese linguistics to study the footage of the incident, which included the audio recording. The Women in Football campaign group said its language expert is certain Mourinho used abusive language, contrary to the verdict of the FA's chosen expert. Mourinho has been cleared of making discriminatory comments to Carneiro, who has since left the club. Rabbatts said the FA had failed to act previously over sexist and abusive chanting towards Carneiro by fans in stadiums. ""I have major concerns over the way in which the disciplinary process has been conducted,"" she added.

86,37215189,"That is about half the list price of the existing product, which is used in emergencies for severe food and insect allergies. Mylan said the generic version would be identical to the branded EpiPen, which costs $600 for two doses. The product generates annual sales of $1bn for Mylan. How much individuals pay for an EpiPen prescription can depend on their insurance coverage. Allergy sufferers often have several pens - one to keep at home, as well as others at school or work, or in the car. Other drug makers including Valeant, Turing and Pfizer have come under fire in recent months for sharp price increases. ""Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response,"" she said. The move is unusual because the branded version is still under patent and other rival treatments have failed to get regulatory clearance. She had previously spoken about the importance of the treatment to her family because of her son's peanut allergy. ""We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option."" Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch said the company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving the product since buying the product from Merck in 2007. Mylan said it expected to start selling a cheaper generic product ""in several weeks"" at a list price of $300 (Â£230). The cost of EpiPens in the US has risen by 500% in less than a decade. Politicians and parents have challenged the price hikes, with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton calling them ""outrageous"" and unjustified. The outcry over EpiPen price rises sent Mylan shares falling about 12% last week. Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said: ""We suspect Mylan will continue to receive some heat for its price increases and there will be heightened pressure on FDA [regulator the Food and Drug Administration] to bring competition to the market."" They also expire after 12 months. Actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who had endorsed EpiPens, said last week she was ending her relationship with Mylan. The stock was flat at $43.04 in afternoon trading in New York. Ms Bresch also blamed the complex US health care system for the price rises and said that Mylan took just $274 of the $600 list price, while insurers, pharmacies and other parties shared the rest.",The maker of the EpiPen will start selling a generic version in the wake of criticism about steep price increases.

90,12325285,"Professor Kirk Erickson and colleagues from the University of Pittsburgh in the US set out to investigate the impact that even moderate exercise might have on preserving memory. But we've shown that even moderate exercise for one year can increase the size of that structure. Until a cure is discovered, finding cheap and simple ways to reverse this trend is imperative, say experts. The year-long trial, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed performance on memory tests also improved. Both groups showed some improvement over time on memory tests. ""Even modest exercise may improve memory and help protect the brain from normal decline caused by ageing. But the findings have important implications for ageing societies faced with a dementia time bomb. In the UK, 820,000 people have dementia, and this figure is set to double by 2030. Professor Erickson said: ""We think of the atrophy of the hippocampus in later life as almost inevitable. The latest work looked at healthy people in their 60s rather than people with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. Dr Simon Ridley of the Alzheimer's Research Trust said that although the study does not look at memory loss in Alzheimer's or dementia, it suggests ""it's never too late to start exercising to help keep our brains healthy"". Scans revealed hippocampus volume increased by around 2% in people who did regular aerobic exercise. The same region of the brain decreased in volume by 1.4% in those who did stretching exercises, consistent with the decrease seen in normal ageing. In the walking group, the improvement appeared to be linked with increased size of the hippocampus. Moderate exercise increased the size of the hippocampus, an area of the brain that makes memories, in 120 volunteers. ""The brain at that stage remains modifiable."" They split their 120 volunteers into two groups. Exercise may buffer against dementia as well as age-related memory loss. ""Increasing evidence suggests regular exercise and a healthy diet may help reduce our risk of developing dementia as well as reaping numerous other benefits from living a healthy lifestyle."" Brain scans and memory tests were performed at the start of the study, halfway through the study and again at the end. One group was asked to begin an exercise regimen of walking around a track for 40 minutes a day, three days a week, while the others were limited to doing simple stretching and toning exercises.","Walking for 40 minutes a few times a week is enough to preserve memory and keep ageing brains on top form, research shows."

The watchdog said the investigation into that case and two others had been completed and all three found no evidence of any misconduct by firearms officers. Since the IPCC was set up in 2004, there have never been more than a handful of fatal police shootings in a year, so the fact there have been six is unlikely to raise alarm bells. The shooting of Khalid Masood was the only one related to terrorism. Investigations into two other shootings are still to conclude. However, the sharp rise in pursuit-related deaths - after a concerted effort by police and the IPCC to reduce the number of such casualties - will prompt searching questions. Dame Anne Owers, chairwoman of the IPCC, said the six fatal shootings occurred across six forces. The six shootings included that of Westminster attacker Khalid Masood. Of the 28 who died, 18 were either passengers in the suspect vehicle or other road users. Does the rise simply reflect an upsurge in criminal activity? The Independent Police Complaints Commission said there were six fatal police shootings between April 2016 to March 2017, up from three in 2015/16. Twenty-eight of the road traffic deaths were related to police pursuits of vehicles. In addition, another inquiry, which is still ongoing, is also yet to find any evidence of wrongdoing by police. It is the highest number in 12 years. Eight of the 14 people who died were reported to have mental health problems. The National Police Chiefs Council and the IPCC will examine whether changes to police pursuit safety or training are needed after the rise in road traffic deaths, added Dame Anne. The number of deaths in police road traffic incidents rose by 11 to 32 - the biggest total in eight years. The IPCC and the National Police Chiefs' Council will have to get to the bottom of it quickly. Is it because suspects have become increasingly reckless? And, as the watchdog points out, the number has to be set in context: there were more than 14,700 police firearms operations during the same 12-month period - the vast majority pass off without a shot being fired, let alone anyone dying. Or have police standards on the roads slipped?","The numbers of fatal police shootings and deaths after police pursuits in England and Wales both rose sharply in the last year, the latest figures show."

Under her rule, the City of London became one of the world's most successful centres for banking and business. Now, more than 20 years on, she is recognised as a prime minister who transformed the face of Britain - and will be remembered as one of the most important figures in modern British history.

But though she had many supporters, some of the changes she introduced were very unpopular and there were protests and riots on the streets. Was Lady Thatcher an inspiration to girls? And in 1990, there was fighting on the streets of London because of a new tax - called the poll tax - that people thought hit poor people harder than the rich. One of her biggest changes was that she wanted private companies and people, and not officials, to run government-owned things like British Gas and BT (British Telecom). She was given a ceremonial funeral with full military honours on 17 April. When she came to power in 1979 she wanted to make big changes to how the country was run - and she transformed Britain. Margaret Thatcher's life in pictures
But eventually even her own party thought she had been in charge too long - and she left Downing Street in tears. Although hundreds of lives were lost, the victory was celebrated on the streets back home. The PM became a hero to many when in 1982 she sent British Troops to defend the Falklands. She died peacefully, aged 87, on Monday the 8th of April 2013. From the start of her time as prime minister Margaret Thatcher divided opinion. She believed that private companies would run the services better. Margaret Thatcher was thought to have survived on just four hours sleep a night - and got the nickname ""the Iron Lady"" for being tough and sticking to her decisions. In 2012 a big movie was made of her life, called The Iron Lady. In 1984 thousands of miners protested for a whole year against her plans to shut down lots of coal mines and cut lots of jobs. After 11 years in power - and winning three elections - she'd been prime minister for longer than anyone else in the 20th century. Thousands of ordinary people were able to buy their council houses, giving them more of a stake in society.",Baroness Thatcher was the UK's first and only female prime minister.

It also reported on the disruptive effect in India of the government removing large amounts of the nation's paper money from circulation, and a new law that will forbid the sale of alcohol close to highways. The UK market was described as resilient and ""dynamic"", because its products were being imported ahead of price increases in March, linked to the weakening of sterling. In Latin America, which has been a strong growth area for Scotch exports, Brazilian sales were weaker due to prolonged recession. In its update for investors, the drinks company reported total sales rose 3% in the first three months of 2017, and the detail gave some pointers to the market for whisky and other drinks around the world. However, the distiller reported that Jameson's, the biggest-selling Irish whiskey, continued to be the star performer among its premium brands. In Scotch whisky, Ballentine's rose 5% by volume over the year, while Chivas was down 5% and Glenlivet single malt by 2%. Among the stronger performers were Absolut vodka and Jameson's. Another French company with a stake in Scotch whisky, Remy-Martin, this week reported that its sales of ""Progressive Hebridean"" spirits, including Bruichladdich and The Botanist gin, rose by more than 10% in the year to March. American sales of the Cork-distilled whiskey were up more than 10%. Pernod Ricard reported the Chinese market ""remains challenging for Scotch"", while there were more positive sales figures for Martell brandy. But sales across the Pernod Ricard brands were strongly up in other countries, led by Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay and Cuba. Its brands include Chivas, The Glenlivet and Ballentine's. Bar and restaurant sales were reported to remain in decline. The company said Korean sales continue a ""strong decline"" across its brands.

Umpires Nick Cook and Jeremy Lloyds confirmed after the match that they were happy with the way the pitch had played and would not call in a pitch liaison officer. Glenn Maxwell's 36 was the only score of any note before Bresnan and Sidebottom came together at 95-9. Prolific Chris Rushworth (4-37) and Graham Onions (3-41) proved too much to handle for the Championship leaders. ""I thought we batted pretty poorly in the morning with some poor shot selection but they also bowled well. With Paul Collingwood absent because of a back problem, acting skipper Mark Stoneman was caught hooking at long leg and 18-year-old debutant Jack Burnham was bowled by Liam Plunkett for a four-ball duck. Durham's decline continued, with Sidebottom taking three of the last four wickets, including Ryan Pringle for 40, as their innings lasted just two balls longer than Yorkshire's. The home side only made 162 despite a last-wicket stand of 67 between Tim Bresnan (47) and Ryan Sidebottom. Yorkshire went into the game with a 34-point lead over Warwickshire, but soon found themselves in dire straits on 54-5. Bresnan was eventually bowled by Paul Harrison, but then struck the first blow in Durham's reply when Graham Clark gave a catch to point. What a fightback it was by our boys who needed to get us back into the game and now the momentum is in our favour but Durham are still a good side. Gary Ballance's hopes of finding form after being omitted from England's Test squad came to nothing as he made six from 27 balls before being caught at slip off Onions. Yorkshire bowler Ryan Sidebottom:
""It was certainly a bizarre day's cricket and I don't think I have played in one on day one like that before. But Sidebottom (4-44) led the way as Durham were dismissed for 156 in reply, with Yorkshire 10-0 at the close.",Yorkshire and Durham proved that Championship cricket can be just as action-packed as an Ashes Test as 20 wickets fell on day one at Scarborough.

So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability. But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC. Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president. The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night.

The latest protests are a reaction to him sacking two finance ministers last week, further damaging confidence in the economy. However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption. ""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me. Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned. It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.

O'Neill and Keane agreed new deals with the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in midweek although contracts have yet to be signed. Do they pay you good money? During his Republic of Ireland stint, which began in November 2013, Keane has twice been linked with the Celtic job but opted to remain as O'Neill's assistant on both occasions. ""We're happy to stay on. In an otherwise good humoured news conference at the Republic's tournament base in Versailles, Keane's brow only furrowed when he was asked whether his contract includes a clause that will allow him to talk to clubs over the next two years.

If some of her own MPs don't like the size of any proposed financial settlement, they may not only suggest it's better to walk away with no deal, but attempt to apply pressure to this end. In Theresa May's letter triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty she states: ""We believe its necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.' But she may find it a challenge to please some of the people some of the time, even in her own party. It's an old political adage but one with which Theresa May will be familiar: ""you cannot please all of the people all of the time."" Bluntly, the divorce bill would have to settled before talks on trade can begin. But Donald Tusk responded today: ""Starting parallel talks on all issues at the same time as suggested by some in the UK will not happen."" Because now her own party's apparent unity is set to be tested. That in turn might lead to the largely self-muting Remainers in her ranks to find their voice. Ahead of a divided Labour Party in the polls, she may be at the zenith of her political popularity. If Theresa May wants a transitional deal, she will have to accept a ""supervisory"" regime for a time - presumably the European Court of Justice whose jurisdiction she wants to end. What's more, only one party to the break-up, the European Council, would decide if the settlement is good enough. And there are more time bombs in Tusk's draft guidelines. So no flames fanned, but it may not be long until Theresa May feels the heat.

One of six councils which does not scan said it was reviewing its policy, but two others have no plans to change. A petition to the assembly wants it to be mandatory to scan microchips of all pets, dead or alive. When the Welsh Government developed microchipping regulations, a survey of councils found most routinely scanned dead dogs found on the roads and informed owners when possible, so compulsory scanning was not included. The rest do ""when they deem the animal in a state to do so"" but the petition calls for this to cover all domestic animals, regardless of their condition, and their owners notified. The petitions said only Gwynedd, Anglesey, Cardiff, Newport, Blaenau Gwent and Neath Port Talbot councils do not routinely scan animals. Cardiff council said dead dogs were scanned and taken to the pound, but not cats - which the authority has been petitioned about separately. Neath Port Talbot said it was reviewing the situation in light of several requests, Blaenau Gwent said it had no plans to scan, as did Anglesey - stating it was not part of its street cleaning contract with a private firm. RSPCA Cymru said it backed mandatory identification of pets killed on highways so owners know what happened.

Mr McCabe says he has been open about his friendship with Mr Docherty, whose wife Sadie is the Lord Provost of Glasgow, but insists that would not affect his judgement on the contract. Critics believe the work should be put out to tender to give others the chance to compete. Recently, Labour councillor Tommy Morgan - who had asked some tough questions over the contract - lost his position as convener of the council's audit and governance panel after a vote of confidence. Under the terms of the contract, the company was expected to deliver efficiency savings every year. Labour has an overall majority on North Lanarkshire Council and holds all the Westminster constituencies in the area. The future of the contract has been caught up in in-fighting between some Labour councillors. The council says Mears has improved the council's repairs service but was losing money on the contract - in part because it had been expected to find efficiency savings every year. However, the area voted Yes in the independence referendum and the SNP has high hopes locally. The boss of Mears Scotland, Willie Docherty, is a personal friend of the council leader Jim McCabe, one of Scotland's longest-serving Labour councillors. Mears was losing money on the work and councillors will be urged to allow the contract to be renegotiated. Councillors on the Policy and Resources Committee are expected to vote to allow the contract to be renegotiated. Morrison Scotland, which was 30% owned by the council, won the contract when it was tendered four years ago. Mr Morgan also became involved in a heated discussion with other councillors over a proposed school closure. Council officers believe these options are riskier, could end up costing more than renegotiation, and are more likely to lead to a legal challenge. The company was later taken over by Mears.",The future of a controversial housing repairs contract will be discussed by councillors in North Lanarkshire later.

But nevertheless it was clear that universities weren't happy, and it was adding to the simmering resentment that had already developed over the government's university tuition fee policy. Even the finance minister Jane Hutt couldn't resist having a swipe at the hundreds of millions of pounds in their coffers, before telling Good Morning Wales why she is rolling back on the proposed cutbacks because of concerns over part-time teaching and scientific research.

In fact, the general cut and the tuition fees policy became enmeshed because the Welsh government had argued that much of the cash reduction was in fact staying in the system because the money was being re-directed to fee subsidies, rather than going directly to the institutions. Labour want the headlines from their latest budget to be about the extra money going into the NHS, and not a fight over funding for scientific research. As we head into an election campaign, there's an argument to say it would have been a huge distraction but also a potential opportunity for the Welsh government to show it wasn't afraid to make unpopular decisions. Be that as it may, there is clearly strong feeling within government that not only can universities afford it, but that their time has come to take a hit after further education colleges took one last year. There has been continued sniping from ministers about the level of reserves held by higher education institutions. In the end, a political decision was taken not to get involved in a scrap with vice-chancellors. Ministers stressed it was a draft budget and, like all drafts, it was open to consultation before changes were made. Universities insist the reserves are needed for investment to continue and for the sector in Wales to remain internationally competitive. The comeback from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales was that only around 60% of the tuition fee grants will stay in Wales as the fees follow the students, wherever they choose to go.","If Labour are still in power after the assembly election, I get the impression it will have some unfinished business with universities."

Liz Nicholl, the chief executive of UK Sport, said: ""If achieved, this would demonstrate the fantastic momentum created by London 2012, where additional investment and focus on developing our high-performance system has benefited summer and winter sports alike."" ""In many ways, the target is indicative of just how far winter sport has progressed in the UK. The best chances of podium finishes in Sochi lie with World Cup leader Lizzy Yarnold and world champion Shelley Rudman in skeleton, freestyle skier James Woods in the new Olympic event of slopestyle and the women's curling team. Speed skater Elise Christie is also a medal contender, while Eve Muirhead's curling rink are the current world champions and picked up silver medals at the European Championships in November. Team GB boss Mike Hay said: ""We view the target as a vote of confidence."" And the funding body predicts there could be as many as seven medals - beating GB's best ever tally of four from Chamonix in 1924. ""It is reflection of the growth we are seeing in competitive strength and depth across many of our winter sports."" Visually-impaired skiers Kelly Gallagher and Jade Etherington will be hoping to come away with Britain's first-ever gold medals at the Paralympic Games while the wheelchair curlers will bid to better the silver they won in Turin in 2006. Britain won only one medal at each of the past two Winter Olympics, with Amy Williams's skeleton gold in Vancouver four years ago the country's first solo gold at a Winter Games for 30 years. That would be Britain's best medal haul at a Winter Games since winning a gold, silver and bronze in Germany in 1936. At least two Paralympic medals are also expected. ""During my 24 years involved in winter sport, I cannot remember a time when Great Britain has had so many talented athletes so well prepared."" ""UK Sport's record investment of funds and expertise has enabled more sports to develop and deliver world-class programmes,"" said Simon Timson, director of performance at UK Sport.","Team GB should expect to win at least three medals at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, according to UK Sport."

111,34787422,"It will need to be tracked over time to learn the shape and extent of its orbit through the Solar System. One explanation is that they have been perturbed gravitationally and pulled on to their strange trajectories by a passing planet - perhaps one that was expelled from our Solar System early in its history. Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos The big question is whether V774104 sweeps inwards from its present location, like Eris, or outwards, like the objects known as 2012 VP113 and Sedna. Models for Solar System formation suggest that such objects were probably not created in these weird, eccentric orbits. The epic robotic explorer has now ventured 20 billion km from home. The team behind the find is led by Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, and Chad Trujillo, from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. They specialise in detecting Solar System outliers. Scientists say their initial studies suggest that the object - catalogued as  V774104 - is some 500-1,000km across. Observations with Japan's Subaru telescope reveal the likely icy body to be some 15.5 billion km from the Sun - about three times further away than even far-flung Pluto. These bodies are currently slightly closer in than Eris, but investigations of their orbits show they will reach far deeper into space, out to 66 billion km and 140 billion km, respectively. That said, the Voyager 1 probe is further away - just. To put some of these numbers in context: Earth is 149 million km from the Sun, and even the most distant major planet - Neptune - seems close at 4.5 billion km, by these standards. The discovery was announced at the 47th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences, taking place in National Harbor near Washington DC. This body, which has a moon, Dysnomia, moves between 5.7 billion km and 14.6 billion km from the Sun. The previously recognised most distant object is the dwarf planet Eris. Some scientists even speculate that such objects could have been stolen from a star that formed from the same ""nursery"" of gas and dust as our Sun 4.6 billion years ago.",Astronomers have identified the most distant object yet in the Solar System.

At his trial, Mr Rajab told the court that he had been held in dire conditions and subjected to ill treatment, including being placed in solitary confinement with a dead animal and kept almost naked. In June 2012, Rajab was sentenced to three months in jail over different tweets he wrote about the prime minister. Rajab, who heads the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), was convicted in 2012 of taking part in illegal gatherings and disturbing public order.

Concerns had been raised over readiness of the two countries to co-host the competition amid threats of fan violence and racism. ""I was surprised by it [Panorama] because in every country you can make this kind of programme,"" insisted Pohorecki. But while admitting lessons had been learned, Pohorecki played down both that incident and also isolated cases of racial abuse from supporters. He added he had been ""surprised"" by the BBC Panorama programme days before the tournament which asked whether Uefa should have chosen Poland and Ukraine to co-host the event after revealing evidence of racist violence at football matches in both countries. Pohorecki backed Uefa president Michel Platini, who said the 2020 European Championship could be spread across various cities in Europe, rather than having a single host. ""And the next tournament is in France so we will pass our knowledge on to them."" ""Never say anything is impossible because everything is possible."" Host nation: France

The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists. He said the company behind the project had subsequently shown its work would not harm local fishing. Legal wrangling
Norte Energia appealed against the decision and Judge Martins ruled on Friday that construction work on the dam could go ahead as the company had shown that local fishing boats would not be blocked or hindered in their work. ""Since the course of the water won't be altered, and there won't be much variation in the speed of its flow, (the project) won't have a major influence on the habitat of ornamental fish species used for fishing,"" he said. Judge Martins had originally ruled in favour of a fisheries group which argued that the dam would affect local fish stocks and could harm indigenous families who make a living from fishing. Norte Energia said the temporary halt on the building work had not affected the project, as it had not yet reached the stage where the company needed to do any of the specific type of work which had fallen under the ban. He also said that any work would have to comply with the regulations laid down by Brazil's Indian Affairs Department (Funai) and the National Environment Agency, Ibama. Judge Carlos Castro Martins reversed the order he had issued in September, which had barred any work on the Belo Monte dam that interfered with the natural flow of the Xingu river. If it goes ahead, the 11,000-megawatt dam will be the third biggest in the world - after the Three Gorges in China and Itaipu, which is jointly run by Brazil and Paraguay. Judge Martins did, however, say that the wider environmental impact of the project ""could only be felt and analysed once the work was completed, as the studies into its effects were only forecasts of what could happen"". The government says it is crucial to meeting growing energy needs, but environmentalists and those fighting for indigenous rights have been vociferous in their opposition.",A judge in Brazil has revoked a decision which had halted work on the Belo Monte dam in the Amazon region.

Lindsay Mackay, the head of HBOS's Treasury division from 2004, could also be banned, November's report said. So far the only person to have been banned is Peter Cummings, who was previously the head of corporate lending at HBOS. Other former HBOS executives named in the report included Lord Stevenson, and Mike Ellis, the former group finance director at HBOS. ""These investigations will determine whether or not any prohibition proceedings should be commenced against them. In 2012, he was fined Â£500,000, and banned from senior positions in banking. Eight former non-executive directors of HBOS were criticised in the report, although they said they disagreed with its findings. Two reports, published in November, criticised the regulator at the time for failing to take action. A Bank of England/FCA report examined the failure of HBOS, while Mr Green examined decisions taken by the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator at the time of the HBOS demise. The FCA and PRA continue to review materials with a view to making further decisions regarding other former HBOS senior managers."" James Crosby, HBOS chief executive from 2001 to 2006, has retired. One of those reports, by barrister Andrew Green QC, said regulators should consider banning 10 former HBOS executives. He gave up his knighthood in 2009, and surrendered part of his pension. No details are being given as to the exact nature of the investigations, who is being investigated, or the timeframe of the inquiry. The eight, including Lord Stevenson and Carphone Warehouse founder Sir Charles Dunstone, said the report had downplayed the ""unforeseeable"" effects of the financial crisis. A new investigation has now been announced by regulators. That included Andy Hornby, HBOS chief executive from 2006 to 2009. Both were published in November. In his report, Mr Green suggested that the Bank of England's PRA and the FCA should consider prohibition proceedings against former executives. Mr Green said the FSA was ""misguided"" when it took the decision not to take action against Mr Hornby.","Regulators are to begin investigations into senior managers at HBOS, the bank which collapsed during the financial crisis."

The treaty was signed by 155 nations and ratified by 126, including Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia.

""I do not support the cumbersome regulations and potentially overzealous international organisations with anti-American biases that infringe upon American society,"" Mr Inhofe said. The White House said it was ""disappointed"" that the ""overwhelming majority"" of Senate Republicans voted against the treaty. Disabled former senator and Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole, who uses a wheelchair, appeared on the floor of the Senate in support. Supporters also said ratification of the treaty would not require any changes to US law. The treaty was backed by Mr Dole, who was disabled in World War II, Arizona Senator John McCain, who sustained disabling injuries in the Vietnam War, Indiana Senator Richard Lugar, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, and former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. This in turn would improve the lives of Americans with disabilities"" who choose to live or travel abroad, the White House added. Others, like Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe, said they voted against the measure because of the extra regulation it would bring with it. However, only eight Republican senators voted in favour of the treaty. It says all nations should work to ensure that disabled people enjoy the same rights and freedoms as other citizens.

According to opposition website, Kalameh, the suspects had been involved in Mr Beheshti's interrogation. What I want is for the world to know that they killed my son.

Last week, three people were reported to have been arrested and subsequently, according to an opposition website, released. Mr Beheshti died after being held on charges of ""actions against national security on social networks"". Mr Beheshti's mother has been forbidden to speak to the press.

""Currently it is deployed on 13 modules, mostly level one modules in order to try to provide timely indicators that students may be struggling. An interesting fact is that the data of the interactions before the course actually starts, like reading the material available and engaging with forums, is extremely valuable. ""That's why data analytics will help provide extra support and can help them be successful.""

Amri was shot dead by police in Milan early last Friday, four days on from the attack. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni told a news conference there was no evidence that Amri had any ""particular networks"" in Italy. The system kicks in when it senses an impact and this may have cut the hijacker's rampage short. Then he took a train to Chambery in the French Alps, changed trains, and reached Milan. The 24-year-old Tunisian had opened fire, wounding one. He was stopped by police in the early hours of 23 December near Milan's Sesto San Giovanni station. German prosecutors say a video in which Amri pledges allegiance to so-called Islamic State (IS) is genuine. Government officials have said the lorry's automatic braking system may have prevented the loss of more lives on 19 December. German state prosecutors said they had found the man's number on the phone of Anis Amri, who killed 12 people by ramming a lorry into market shoppers.

""We went down to Bisham Abbey - the old England stomping ground - a couple of weeks ago with Stuart and were training down there for about two-and-a-half hours,"" he said. ""We've got a young squad and Stuart Pearce's legs aren't as fresh as they used to be so we'll run some rings around him,"" he said. So things are getting better and the confidence is in the side."" Pearce, who won 78 England caps, was part of Sir Bobby Robson's squad that reached the last four of the World Cup in Italy in 1990, and the Terry Venables-led side that was eliminated at the same stage of Euro '96. He retired from playing six years after that, having enjoyed spells at Newcastle United, Manchester City, West Ham, Coventry and non-league Wealdstone, as well as captaining Forest under the management of Brian Clough. But following their star January signing, club treasurer Mike Dean said the squad had been training hard and ""games haven't been as bad"". He was due to get his boots on for the Gloucestershire non-leaguers last month, but the match was called off. ""We have been getting beat but the scores are only 1-0, 2-0 - very low now. Rooted to the bottom of the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League Division Two, Longford AFC has lost all its games this season and conceded nearly 200 goals - earning it the name of ""the worst team in England"". A club spokesman said with Pearce on side, it was hoping to get its ""very first win of the season"" on Saturday.","England football legend Stuart Pearce is set to finally make his debut for a team dubbed ""the worst in the UK""."
139,39076399,"Careers Wales said it is facing a ""budget shortfall"" and ""all options"" are being explored. Richard Spear, chief executive of Careers Wales, said: ""An anticipated reduction in our overall funding for 2017-2018 and a need to make further savings has resulted in a budget shortfall for the organisation. ""This is a ridiculous way to plan and fund a key public service."" ""We will attempt to make the required savings via a voluntary early release scheme, in line with compulsory redundancy-avoidance best practice."" The Welsh Government said the fund was a one-off project actually worth £1.7m, and it was disingenuous to suggest extra funding had been withdrawn. He said a 30-day consultation had started. Unison said Careers Wales staff numbers have halved in the last five years and it was making the staff cuts despite bidding to provide the Welsh Government's Employability and Apprenticeship training programme. Unison said all employees of Careers Wales, which provides careers advice and information and is funded by Welsh ministers, had been written to asking if they would take voluntary redundancy. The union said that, although Careers Wales' core funding for the year remained at £18m from the year before, the organisation was facing a £2.7m cut in overall funding for 2016-17 through the withdrawal of a fund that had prevented redundancies in the last financial year. ""All options are being explored to address this shortfall. The Welsh Government said it was aware Careers Wales was consulting on a ""voluntary release scheme"". A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We are aware of Careers Wales' decision to initiate consultation on a voluntary release scheme and we hope and expect that Careers Wales, its staff and trade unions can work collaboratively on this issue to improve the long-term efficiency and financial sustainability of this important service."" A total of 60 jobs at Careers Wales, which employs around 600, are to be axed, the union has said. Jeff Baker, Unison regional organiser, said: ""The government's plans don't make any sense."" ""The Welsh Government hasn't concluded its strategic review with Careers Wales and by slashing funding to that organisation, it's forcing Careers Wales to sack people and its future is threatened.","One tenth of the workforce at a Welsh Government-funded careers service is facing redundancy, according to Unison."

Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed it was providing consular assistance, but did not give further details. Ms Sainsbury's family claims she is innocent of drug trafficking charges. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs in Colombia are severe and offenders can expect long prison sentences under harsh conditions. ""And this is where the naive bit comes in, she didn't even rip it open to make sure there were headphones in there."" Ms Sainsbury's mother, Lisa Evans, claimed her daughter was the ""naive"" victim of a Colombian man she had befriended during her trip. She could face up to 25 years in jail, according to her sister, Khala. ""The day of her departure, he came up to her hotel, gave her a package that was wrapped in black plastic and she took it and put it in her luggage,"" she told Australian radio station KIIS FM. They said she was being held at El Buen Pastor, Colombia's largest women's prison. The family has started an online campaign to help cover legal fees, raising A$2,600 (Â£1,500; $2,000) in four days. The personal trainer, from Adelaide, had just finished a working holiday when she was arrested at El Dorado International Airport, her family said. Cassie Sainsbury, 22, was stopped at an airport in Bogota on 12 April. According to Ms Evans, Ms Sainsbury's lawyer has recommended a guilty plea to avoid a maximum sentence up to 25 years in jail. If Ms Sainsbury pleads guilty, she would face a six-year sentence, which could be reduced further if she gives information about the man who supplied the headphones, Ms Evans said. Colombia is one of the world's largest producers of coca leaves and cocaine.","An Australian woman has been arrested in Colombia after being found with 5.8kg (12lb 13oz) of cocaine in her luggage, her family says."

""But of course we do want to see a government formed in which people all across the country feel they have a genuine stake and representation."" The UK foreign secretary announced on Twitter he had arrived in Irbil to meet Kurdish regional government officials. ""It's not for us from any other country to say who should be the prime minister of Iraq.

""I think it will be important in this new and deeply concerning situation to make sure that every loophole is being dealt with to make sure it is difficult for terrorist groups to use economic assets they have seized, to take advantage of the financial system,"" he said. He discussed ways of curbing militants' access to finance and arms. ""I feel it will be necessary to have new and strong international agreement on how to tackle these things."" Mr Hague, who held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki on Thursday, has warned that the country is facing an ""existential threat"". The government has bought second-hand jet fighters from Russia and Belarus to try to stem the insurgents' advances. Speaking at a press conference with Masoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan region, Mr Hague said the UK would press for action at the UN to stem the flow of arms from insurgents and stop their access to finance. The BBC's Jim Muir in Irbil said Mr Hague was pressed over whether he backed calls from many Sunni and Kurdish leaders for Mr Maliki to stand down to aid a process of reconciliation. ""I found in Baghdad a strong consciousness of the need for a new and inclusive government that creates a stronger sense of partnership between Shias and Sunnis and Kurds,"" he said.",William Hague has held talks with Kurdish leaders about international efforts to confront Islamist extremists threatening to overrun parts of Iraq.

The Norwegian was new to the Celtic manager's job when his team was knocked out in the play-off round last season by Slovenian side Maribor. ""We knew if we were at our best we had a good chance to go through but we were not even close. But having reshaped the team on his way to winning the Scottish Premiership in his debut season and across this summer, he was confident he could guide them into the group stage of the Champions League at the expense of the Swedish champions. ""We have shown that the Europa League is the level we have to compete at and it is better than nothing. ""It was a team performance that was not at the level we should expect at these games.

144,36228720,"""However, I would emphasize that no final decision has been taken in relation to these proposals, which are the subject of a detailed collective consultation process which began on Tuesday 3 May 2016 and which will last for at least 30 days and possibly more. Mick Conroy, GMB Scotland senior officer, said: ""In the year of Tannoy's 90th anniversary, it's an absolute tragedy that the long-serving Coatbridge workforce has been rewarded with the sack. ""A key priority of the next Scottish government must be to address our manufacturing crisis by bringing forward a meaningful industrial strategy that can help steer our economy back towards growth."" ""These latest redundancies also show the total free-fall in Scotland's manufacturing sector as our slide towards a low-skill, low-wage and precarious economy gathers apace without any intervention. He added: ""Music is of course mindful of its obligation to seek out any suitable alternative employment for any employees whom it is confirmed are to be made redundant, and to that end the company will be doing all that it can to try to identify any suitable alternative roles which may exist in any of its operations in Europe and beyond."" Tannoy is one of the oldest audio brands in the world, having been founded as the Tulsemere Manufacturing Company in 1926. Production of audio equipment at the plant is understood to be moving to China. ""In the event that the proposed dismissals are ultimately confirmed following the conclusion of the consultation process, the Coatbridge facility would cease operations and the plant would close. The Music Group said a consultation on redundancies at its Tannoy loudspeaker production facility in Coatbridge began on Tuesday. Peter Sommer, senior vice president of lifestyle at The Music Group, said: ""I can confirm that Music does propose to dismiss as redundant around 70 staff at its manufacturing and office facility in Coatbridge. ""Given that the proposals are at a formative stage, there is of course no definitive time scale in place, but it is envisaged that any closure would likely be towards the end of the year."" It has had a base in Coatbridge since the 1970s. The company remains active in a range of audio sectors including residential hi-fi and studio monitoring.

145,14213165,"But the Sao Paulo side's response to City's demand for a proper payment schedule on Tuesday was perhaps a sign the transfer would not have gone smoothly. Corinthians still want Tevez and hinted an agreement can be reached in January. That would indicate that Corinthians may look to revive the deal in the January transfer window, although that would not be the preferred option of Tevez or his current club. However, there are few clubs who can match the asking price of about £40m. Tevez, who is contracted to City until 2014, has been a key player for the club since arriving from neighbours Manchester United in 2009. Corinthians' move for Tevez - which emerged on Monday - was believed to be funded by a new television deal for Brazilian clubs. Tevez, who had a spell at Corinthians from 2005 to 2006, originally asked City for a transfer in December and has since reiterated that desire to leave so he can be closer to his family in Argentina. City thought a £40m deal had been agreed for the Argentine striker after he told the Premier League outfit he wanted to return to South America. It had appeared that the former West Ham forward had got his wish for a transfer but then in a statement, Corinthians said: ""The board of Sporting Club Corinthians hereby officially announce the impossibility of hiring the Argentine striker Carlos Tevez. He helped Mancini's side to FA Cup success and Champions League qualification in the 2010/2011 campaign. The breakdown of Tevez's transfer to Corinthians also leaves City manager Roberto Mancini's proposed move for Atletico Madrid striker Sergio Aguero in doubt. He has scored 43 Premier League goals in his two seasons at City - the highest total of any player in the top division. ""We are aware of the dream our fans had of having this player at Corinthians again and we look forward to him being with us in the near future."" ""While acknowledging the efforts of Manchester City and all involved in the negotiation, more time is needed for the transfer to be achieved, given that the window to sign players from abroad closes on Wednesday, 20 July [Brazilian time]. But Corinthians said there was not enough time to sign the the 27-year-old before the Brazilian transfer window closes at 0400 BST on Thursday.",Carlos Tevez's move from Manchester City to Corinthians has fallen through because the Brazilian club pulled out.

""I could almost see the wreck of Arizona"" out of the window, Mr Radford later wrote in his memoir, referring to a battleship that sank in the attack. He became the first serving US president to visit the Japanese city, where about 150,000 people are believed to have been killed in 1945 by a US atomic bomb.

The first Japanese leader to visit Pearl Harbor was Shigeru Yoshida who in 1951 stopped over in Hawaii both on the way to and from the signing of the peace treaty with the US in San Francisco. Mr Abe will pray for the dead but will not issue an apology, his aides said. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour killed 2,300 US servicemen and propelled the US into World War Two. But the key US aircraft carriers were at sea at the time. His visit on the way home included a meeting with the commander of the US Pacific fleet, Admiral Arthur Radford. The office where the two men met offered a direct view of the site of the Japanese attack. After landing, the Japanese prime minister first headed to National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, and laid down a wreath. On Tuesday, Mr Abe and Mr Obama will pray for the dead at the site of the attack before holding a summit meeting in Hawaii, their last before Mr Obama steps down in January. He stood for a moment of silence at the cemetery near downtown Honolulu, a memorial to those who died.","Japanese PM Shinzo Abe has visited several memorials in Hawaii, ahead of a visit to Pearl Harbor, the US naval base attacked by the Japanese in 1941."

Mr Carlyle said he pressed an alarm that was supposedly inaudible but turned out to be audible. The court was told McIvor, who has 17 pages of previous conviction, had a drug problem.

But the Aberconway MP said he took a different view. Now the Welsh secretary has pledged to keep Wales at the discussion table on the future of devolved powers across Britain. He said he is also arranging meetings with party leaders in the National Assembly to ensure their views feed into the debate. Mr Crabb said he had already held preliminary discussions with Mr Hague, a former Welsh secretary himself. That has led to Labour Party leader Ed Miliband accusing Mr Cameron of planning to set the UK nations against each other. One of the two Welsh MPs to attend was the Aberconway MP, Guto Bebb. ""I want to move forward in a realistic, open-minded and pragmatic way."" ""We are both in absolute agreement that Wales should be central to the debate that is now commencing,"" said Mr Crabb. Mr Crabb's comments come as Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones called for a convention on future of the UK. ""I want us to use this opportunity positively to look again at how we secure the best possible devolution settlement for Wales. The comments from Mr Crabb came as Prime Minister David Cameron hosted discussions with backbench Tory MPs at his Chequers country residence. The meeting is likely to take place when parliament returns next month. Mr Crabb has written to the leaders of other Welsh parties at Westminster inviting them to a Wales Office ""summit"" to discuss ""how we deliver devolution that works for Wales"". Key to Monday's talks have been the issue of ""English votes for English laws"", which would see Welsh and Scottish MPs excluded from voting on devolved matters in the House of Commons. Speaking on Tuesday at the Labour Party conference, Mr Jones said the union cannot be rebuilt through conversation between only Westminster and Scotland. A new UK cabinet committee chaired by Commons Leader William Hague will now meet for the first time on Wednesday. ""The promises made to Scotland must be delivered upon and if they are delivered on then we are going to end up in my view with English votes for English laws and that in my view is a simple matter of fairness,"" said Mr Bebb.

It was agreed that a pilot project carried out by the FA and Scottish Football Association relating to revolving substitutes in amateur football will continue, as will a Uefa experiment into the use of a sin bin in recreational football. From the time the new rule comes in to place, incidents such as Mario Balotelli's infamous ""Why Always Me?""

Meanwhile, the IFAB rejected a proposal from Uefa to amend the so-called ""triple punishment"" which occurs when a penalty kick is given within a game, warranting a player being sent off and a possible goal being scored. The IFAB also discussed the potential use of video replays for match officials but remains of the view that technology should be allowed only for goal-line incidents because ""it is a clear yes or no decision"".

150,31970403,"Giving evidence at Holyrood, Assistant Chief Constable Bernie Higgins said armed officers were among the best trained in the force. Mr Higgins said: ""Based on the information the firearms officers had that time, their actions were entirely appropriate. In October, following pressure from politicians and civic society, Police Scotland said specialist armed police officers in Scotland would in future only be deployed to firearms incidents or where there is a threat to life. But he accepted police intelligence could sometimes get it wrong. He told MSPs then a review of the policy was currently being undertaken and was close to being finalised. Assistant Chief Constable Higgins said in another instance armed officers had comforted an injured pensioner in the street and intervened to prevent street brawls developing further. One was stabbed four times, he said, but the officers did not shoot the attacker because they feared it would put members of the public standing nearby at risk. Assistant Chief Constable Higgins told Holyrood's justice sub-committee that during a recent incident in Edinburgh two armed officers were confronted with a man wielding a knife. But he also confirmed that they had issued fixed penalties for public urination, drinking in the street and breach of the peace. The force backed down from its policy of arming some officers for routine duties following a backlash last year. Some MSPs raised concerns about armed police seen shopping in supermarkets. Earlier this month, in front of the same committee, Assistant Chief Constable Higgins said since October 2014 armed officers had ""engaged with the public"" on 1,644 occasions, including stopping drink-drivers and helping find missing people. Police Scotland received more than 5,000 complaints since May in total, said Assistant Chief Constable Higgins, ranging from incivility to use of excessive force. During Thursday's session, Assistant Chief Constable Higgins also accepted criticism of police intelligence which led to a 91-year-old driver being ordered from his car at gunpoint by four armed officers. ""There was criticism of Police Scotland in terms of the intelligence that was held, the information that was held, and how quickly or otherwise that was passed to firearms officers.""","Police Scotland has received 27 complaints from members of the public since May about its controversial armed policing policy, MSPs heard."

The Treasury estimates that the debt interest rate relief cap, alongside other measures, will help raise £8bn over the next five years. The chancellor also announced a number of reforms designed to help small businesses cope with what he called ""the great unfairness"" they faced when trying to compete with some suppliers selling goods online. Among those other measures was the announcement that firms making an annual profit of over £5m would face the prospect of having the amount of past losses they could carry forward to offset their corporation tax bill capped to 50% of current profits. From April 2017, 600,000 small firms will not have to pay business rates, while 250,000 will pay lower rates. He also introduced two new tax-free allowances worth £1,000 a year for so-called micro-entrepreneurs:  people who make money from occasional jobs or through renting out property they own. But she added: ""Changes to the tax treatment of losses will make it harder for larger scale-up firms and companies that have been through tough times to play their part in the recovery."" Mr Osborne said the government would take measures to stop overseas retailers storing goods in the UK and then selling the goods online without paying VAT. George Osborne also said corporation tax would be cut to 17% by 2020. Mike Cherry, policy director at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""The chancellor has listened to our calls for the tax system to be made simpler for small businesses and the self-employed and taken important action on business rates."" Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI business lobby group, said: ""The reduction in the headline corporation tax rate sends out a strong signal that the UK is open for global business investment, and reforms to interest deductibility are rightly in line with the international consensus. He said that the 600,000 small businesses relieved of paying business rates from next April would see an annual saving of nearly £6,000. To fund the giveaway, the chancellor capped debt interest payments used by larger firms to cut their corporation tax bills, to 30% of earnings. Mr Osborne said his business tax reforms were part of a ""Budget for small business"".",Small businesses have welcomed what they said were long overdue reforms to tax policy as the chancellor doubled business rate relief.

""This is clearly a very difficult time for the club, but we remain confident we can retain our position in the Premiership,"" added Bristol chairman Chris Booy. Robinson only signed a new three-year contract with the Ashton Gate side in August, but they have since lost all nine of their competitive fixtures - including two in the European Challenge Cup.

""We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers,"" said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes. Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. The new rules must be renewed in three years, he said. Some US government agencies expressed serious reservations about the new rules, and the Environmental Protection Agency flatly opposed them. Vehicle manufacturers opposed the move, saying repair garages could fix any issues. ""EPA explained that vehicle modifications are often performed to increase engine power or boost fuel economy, but that these modifications increase vehicle emissions and thus violate the Clean Air Act,"" the Library of Congress said in its final rule.

""Without any doubt it's the right decision, the idea was to give more awareness to the Nissan brand,"" he told the BBC. Mr Ghosn said there was ""no doubt"" that prices for Renaults, and other cars made in Europe and sold in the UK, will rise due to the falling value of the British pound. The company's goal with the Olympics sponsorship is to help increase its market-share in Brazil from 3% to 5%, he said. However, he thinks final prices will only be determined once the currency stabilises. ""That will determine how, and how much we will invest in the UK,"" he said. Carlos Ghosn said there was a need to build a ""much higher awareness"" of the company's products in Brazil. The company will be keeping a close eye on future negotiations over the UK's exit from the European Union. The UK economy will see some contraction due to Brexit, ""not because there is anything wrong with the UK, but because markets hate uncertainty,"" Mr Ghosn said.

The court said on Thursday that it wasn't expressing an opinion on Milke's guilt or innocence but merely on the validity of a retrial. Prosecutors had pushed for a retrial but a panel of three judges said such a move would amount to double jeopardy. ""Non-disclosure of this magnitude calls into question the integrity of the system and was highly prejudicial to Milke,"" the court said. Debra Milke, then a 25-year-old insurance company clerk, was accused of dressing her son in his favourite outfit and telling him he was going to see Santa Claus at a local mall. However, prosecutors can still appeal to the state's Supreme Court. Lawyers for Ms Milke said they were ""thrilled"" at the decision not to allow a retrial. ""She shouldn't walk free, because she's guilty,"" he told the Associated Press. However, Mr Saldate did not record the confession and has since been implicated in several cases of misconduct including lying under oath. An appeals court ruled last year that prosecutors had known about Mr Saldate's misconduct but failed to disclose the information. The two men who carried out the killing remain on death row. Debra Milke was freed in September 2013 after a record of misconduct by a key detective in the case emerged. Four-year-old Christoper Milke was then taken by two men to a desert area north of Phoenix where he was shot three times in the head. An appeals court in Arizona ruled on Thursday that the she could not be tried again in relation to the killing. The case against Ms Milke rested largely on a purported confession to that detective. Mr Saldate said he feared potential charges if he testified again, and in December a judge granted his request not to give evidence at any retrial.

Google, most of whose UK sales are routed through Ireland, is one of the multinationals strongly criticised for organising their tax affairs in ways that minimise the amounts they pay in the UK. Google paid Â£10m in UK corporate taxes between 2006 and 2011. Meanwhile, the head of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge, has suggested a new committee should be established to oversee the tax arrangements of major firms.

It's not a debate. ""Politicians - not companies - [should] set the rules...When legislators are doing the lobbying and companies are articulating the law as it stands, it's a confusing spectacle for everyone,"" he recently wrote in the Observer. Mr Schmidt said it was up to the government to change its tax system if it wanted companies to pay more taxes. She told the Independent newspaper that such a committee could hear evidence from companies in secret, meaning that companies would not be able to hide their tax affairs behind confidentiality rules.

170,36382450,"Retail Acquisitions Limited did not delve very deeply into the pension problems. He appears before the committees on 8 June. Why did they believe that a retail novice with a chequered financial background could succeed in turning BHS around when a feted retail tycoon had failed? He was joined in the commons by representatives from accountants Grant Thornton and lawyers Olswang to explain their involvement as advisers to Mr Chappell. Mr Frangos said that BHS was not the limit of his ambitions and that Chappell had plans to one day buy Arcadia - the parent company run by Sir Philip Green. Andrew Frangos of Cornhill Capital was approached by the three-time bankrupt Chappell to raise money secured against property to use as working capital - the money you need for day to day running of a company. We got two interesting answers. Meetings between Chappell and the Chris Martin, chair of the BHS pension scheme, totalled less than half an hour and Grant Thornton's Mark Byers said he was denied the usual access to the pension trustees and their advisors. What is emerging from these sessions is that lots of professional firms were tasked with making sure small bits of the deal ticked a number of boxes. No one, it seems, was there to look Mr Chappell in the eye and judge whether he had the ability, or even the intention, of making BHS work. That's how one financier described Dominic Chappell's plans for acquiring and reviving BHS to MPs today. Mark Byers, from Grant Thornton said it would be difficult to have that negotiation, for BHS essentially to plead poverty, as long as BHS was part of the bigger Arcadia group. Both made extensive use of client confidentiality protection but several important themes emerged. Second, it wasn't their job. On the bigger picture, MPs asked what the professional advisers made of this ""punt"". MPs will no doubt suggest that role fell to Sir Philip Green himself as the seller. First, a central part of the turnaround plan involved getting the landlords for the 164 stores to agree to reduce the rent. Ultimately, Chappell didn't use Cornhill Capital and the two of them are in dispute over unpaid bills. So far there is no smoking gun.","""A bit of a punt"" - the BHS business plan."

At least 10 fire crews from around the county were tackling the fire, with extra foam units brought in from London and Essex. ""We worked alongside our partners from the London Fire Brigade and Essex Fire and Rescue Service and I think praise goes to everyone for a job well done."" Mr Gash said crews were confronted by a very serious fire involving road tanker vehicles carrying 1,000-litre containers of reclaimed engine oil and numerous 200-litre barrels of oil which were exploding. The fire started in two road tankers before spreading to plastic and steel drum oil containers. One eyewitness described the fire at Eco-Oil Ltd at the Kingsnorth Industrial Estate at Hoo as ""huge"". He added: ""This particular area is not very well served with a good water supply so we had to run in two water mains from Kingsnorth power station."" Graham Gash, area manager from Kent Fire and Rescue said: ""Crews have done a great job in fighting this serious fire and successfully managing to prevent it spreading further and damaging nearby buildings. He added: ""More importantly, we had fuel that was flowing from the site and this posed a significant threat to the surrounding building which was three industrial units."" Kent Fire and Rescue Service managed to contain burning oil which spread on to adjacent land cleared for development. Mr Gash said there was minimal risk to people nearby because the industrial estate was surrounded by commercial industrial retail outlets and not residential areas. Firefighters said the blaze started at about 2300 BST and was finally brought under control at around 0545 BST. He said the brigade's fire investigation team would be investigating the cause of the fire along with Kent Police. The fire officer said foam had to be used to put out a very hot oil fire, while two high volume water supplies were needed for a major foam strike - one for cooling and one for foam production. No casualties have been reported. He said crews were working to make sure the fire was out and checking the industrial units with thermal imaging cameras to make sure there had been no undetected fire spread.",More than 60 firefighters have spent the night tackling a major blaze at a waste oil depot near Kingsnorth power station in Kent.

The chief executive of Very.co.uk and Littlewoods, Alex Baldock, told the BBC said that he expected this year's Cyber Monday to be bigger than Black Friday last year. Shoppers are expected to spend almost £1bn online on Monday - up almost a third from last year, according to analysts at Experian-IMRG. Visa Europe said: ""It looks like Black Friday has cemented its place as the busiest online shopping day of the year. However, he added: ""A staggering 10% of that won't be delivered on time and that's because retailers haven't got their back-end fulfilment capabilities - their organisation, processes and infrastructure - in place to cope with the marketing hype that has been created around Black Friday."" According to Experian-IMRG, £1.1bn was spent online on Black Friday, up more than a third from last year. ""More than £760m was spent online with Visa cards, up nearly 25% on last year,"" it said, adding that £2.2bn is predicted to be spent online on its cards over the four-day period. But he warned customers that deliveries could take as long as 10 days rather than the usual 48 hours, adding that he expects 100,000 new customers to log on over the period. Amazon said it had its biggest sales day in the UK on Friday, selling more than 7.4 million items. After chaotic scenes at some stores on Black Friday last year, this year saw much calmer trading as more shoppers decided to hunt for bargains online. Sales are expected to hit record numbers over the weekend, following the Black Friday sales promotions. Adding to warnings about deliveries, logistics expert Stuart Higgins from LCP Consulting told the BBC that Black Friday's orders equated to about 22 million parcels, with a similar volume expected to be generated on Monday. Department chain John Lewis said that this year's Black Friday saw its biggest ever single-day trade, up 11.9% compared with last year, mainly driven by sales on its website. Analyst Miya Knight from Planet Retail said that Currys and PC World saw online traffic increase 1000% on the morning of Black Friday.","Cyber Monday is expected to add to one of the busiest weekends for online shopping, following Black Friday."

175,33648595,"Nikkei is one of Japan's oldest and most prestigious newspaper groups, and has managed impressive staying power at a time when the industry is on the decline. FT Editor Lionel Barber has assured his staff that the paper's editorial integrity will not be compromised - no matter how high the price-tag. Critics say Nikkei is often a public relations machine for Japanese corporates - and that will clash with the fiercely independent Financial Times. In 2012 Mr Kita reportedly said that he wanted to make Nikkei a global company, in the same way as the Japanese convenience store sector, which has had success in foreign markets. In 2014 Mr Kita told a group of newspaper distributors and vendors that Nikkei had to strengthen sales and secure revenue in the light of decreasing print circulation figures. The Nikkei group has steered clear of recent Japanese corporate scandals like Toshiba's earnings debacle and the Olympus accounting fiasco in 2011 - a story the FT broke. He owns the Japanese Nikkei group media house, which has just acquired the Financial Times from UK publishing group Pearson for $1.3bn (Â£844m). He is also a big believer in the digital subscription model - a natural synergy, then, with the FT, which now derives 70% of its business from its online and mobile audiences. The acquisition of the FT allows him to realise those ambitions. But it is the FT's digital success that Nikkei wants to emulate. However, analysts are wondering whether he has paid too high a price for the luxury of owning the FT -  three times as much as it is thought the pink paper is worth. But how will the two cultures of the two media houses merge? The acquisition is being called a bold and brave move for Nikkei - and it is a strategy Mr Kita has been pursuing for some time. And he has long held global ambitions for the firm. But little is known about the man behind the deal - except for the fact that in previous interviews he has alluded to the need for the Nikkei group to expand.",Tsuneo Kita is now arguably one of the most influential men on the global media landscape.
176,19436926,"She suggested that people were not concerned about pacing themselves with soft drinks, which could explain why glass shape had no effect on them. The shape of a glass has already been shown to affect how much alcohol people pour. There was no difference in the drinking time for soft drinks. She said altering the glasses used in pubs could ""nudge"" people to drink more healthily by ""giving control back"". The researchers thought that curvy glasses made it harder to pace drinking because judging how much was in the glass became more difficult owing to its curved shape. However, researchers at the University of Bristol believe the shape of beer glasses affects the speed people drink. So it is not certain what happens on an evening out if multiple drinks are consumed. The report said: ""Drinking time is slowed by almost 60% when an alcoholic beverage is presented in a straight glass compared with a curved glass."" However, the study looked only at the time taken to finish one drink in a laboratory setting. The glasses all contained around half a pint of liquid, but some of the glasses were straight while others were very curved. The group of drinkers was shown a variety of pictures of partially-filled beer glasses and asked to say whether they were more or less than half full. The team said people were more likely to get the answer wrong when assessing the amount of liquid in curved glasses. A study in 2005 showed people were more likely to pour extra alcohol into short, wide glasses than tall, narrow ones. People drinking from both straight and curved glasses finished after around seven minutes. However, for the beer drinkers there was a large difference between the two groups. While it took around seven minutes for people drinking from a curved glass to polish off their half pint, it took 11 minutes for those drinking from a straight glass. They argue that the curvy glassware makes pacing yourself a much greater challenge. The lead researcher Dr Angela Attwood told the BBC: ""They are unable to judge how quickly they are drinking so cannot pace themselves."" A group of 159 men and women were filmed drinking either soft drinks or beer as part of the study. Their study, published in the journal PLoS ONE, suggests people drink more quickly out of curved glasses than straight ones.",The shape of your glass is probably the last thing on your mind when you are down the pub.

She said: ""These issues range from people not picking-up after their dog has gone to the toilet to dogs disturbing livestock, game birds or wildlife.

Anne Gray, policy officer with Scottish Land and Estates, said a variety of problems related to dog walking were reported to her every year. The advice includes opening up less sensitive areas to dog walkers rather than trying to ban them completely. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), which has issued the advice, had previously heard complaints about ""significant problems"" with irresponsible owners. She said: ""These high numbers show how dog walking helps lots of people get healthy outdoor activity, but it's really important to minimise the number of occasions when dogs cause land managers' concerns. ""We want everyone to have a good experience of being out and about in the countryside."" ""NFUS is pleased to support the guidance, which should go some way to helping some land managers in ensuring that they are clear about access rights, and also assist them in finding innovative ways to address issues where they occur."" Drawing on the experiences of farmers and estate owners, the guidance also encourages landowners to explain why certain places should be avoided. ""This guidance aims to influence the behaviour of the minority of dog walkers who act irresponsibly - actions that can have a big impact on livestock and wildlife, as well as those who are trying to enjoy the outdoors without getting dog dirt on their shoes.""

182,33612925,"""There does come a point where we need to stop talking and get on with taking some action,"" she said. A similar process would be used, including Welsh MPs, where matters covered only England and Wales. The Conservatives made a manifesto commitment to give English MPs a decisive say over legislation exclusively affecting England but have run into trouble over the details of the plan and how it will be introduced. Peers defied the government by backing calls to set up a joint parliamentary committee to look at the proposals. Peers have now backed calls by Lord Butler, the former cabinet secretary and crossbench peer, for a special committee of MPs and peers to look into the proposals in depth. Ministers have had to redraft plans to give English MPs an effective veto on laws deemed to apply to England only and to delay a vote amid opposition. Lord Lawson and Lord Forsyth were among Conservative peers to rebel as the government lost by 320 votes to 139. The Leader of the Lords, Lady Stowell, maintained that peers would get a debate on the plans in the autumn, but after 30 years of trying to find a solution to the problem of English-only laws it was time to take action. The vote does not bind the government unless the House of Commons also agrees to such a move. But the SNP has said they will be excluded them from votes on matters affecting Scotland and create two classes of MP in the Commons while Labour has said the proposals are being rushed and need more detailed scrutiny. Lord Butler said he backed the principle of requiring laws affecting England to have the consent of a majority of English MPs but there were better ways of approaching what has long been known as the ""West Lothian question""
""Surely it is more important to get the proposals right than to rush them through,"" he said. The plan is for a new Commons stage to be introduced for laws passing through Parliament with England's MPs asked to accept or veto legislation only affecting England before it passes to a vote of all UK MPs at third reading. Ministers say this will address the longstanding anomaly by which Scottish MPs can vote on issues such as health and education affecting England but English MPs have no say on similar matters relating to Scotland, where such policies are devolved.","The government has been defeated in the House of Lords over plans for so-called ""English votes for English laws""."

In February, Libya claimed their first senior African title, winning the 2014 African Nations Championship (CHAN), a tournament they were originally set to host. Algeria, Cameroon, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Zambia are bidding. Libya's government said last year it hoped the hosting of the Nations Cup would allow it to demonstrate that life had returned to normal in the country and encourage investors. The civil unrest in the country meant that the event ended up taking place in South Africa instead. African football's ruling body also state that because of the limited time left to organise the 2017 Nations Cup, the Caf Executive Committee will select a host country who can guarantee that accommodation, transportation and hotel facilities, as well as training sites and stadiums already exist. Former World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer had accepted a role as an ""ambassador"" to help promote the tournament and the country and the former Spain coach Javier Clemente was hired to prepare their team for the tournament.

It will not. But there is a political reason for Parliament to listen. But he said it will not be a veto on leaving the EU. That means there might be a vote in the assembly on triggering Article 50, as well as in Westminster. And if Parliament must vote on Brexit, it leaves the door ajar for the assembly to influence things. Mr Antoniw said there was ""every likelihood of a vote (in the assembly) because a trigger bill will impact on Welsh legislation"". Analysis by BBC Wales political correspondent Daniel Davies
It sounds like the eleven Supreme Court judges sent the Welsh Government packing. Counsel General Mick Antoniw said he was ""delighted"" by the Supreme Court ruling against the UK government on Brexit. But Tuesday's ruling that AMs do not have a veto on Brexit means that whether or not the vote has meaning will depend on the UK government's reaction. AMs could decide to hold a vote in the assembly on article 50 if they feel that the legislation on article 50 affects devolution. All sides agree the assembly does not have a power of veto. Mr Antoniw said it is likely AMs would get a vote on the triggering process. There is a convention - called the Sewel Convention - whereby the assembly has a say on legislation in Westminster that affects devolution in the form of a vote in the chamber. The court also said UK ministers were ""not legally compelled"" to consult the devolved legislatures in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The court ruled Theresa May cannot trigger Article 50 - the formal exit process from the EU - without the backing of MPs and peers. They all agree: there's no legal reason for Theresa May to consult the assembly.

Only 16 cleric MPs have been voted in, meaning the new parliament will include more women than religious leaders. President Rouhani lent support to her in his speech on Sunday when he told an audience ""18 female legislators"" had been voted in. The number of clerics in parliament in Iran has steadily declined over the years from 164 in the first parliament just after the Islamic revolution in 1979. Four women were elected in the run-off, joining other women who had been voted in already. Country profile: Iran
Full figures for 2015 can be found on the World Bank website. Islamic hardliners see the declining number of clerics elected as a threat to the Islamic revolution and have called on more clerics to come forward and enter politics - at a time when many ordinary people are turning away from the religious leaders. This shift is also apparent in the fact that almost all hardline clerics lost their seats. It was President Hassan Rouhani's first reaction to the results of Friday's run-off election, in which moderates and reformists won a working majority. The outgoing parliament includes nine female representatives. The 17 women elected make up 6% of the new cohort of 290 MPs. President Rouhani acknowledged the new record and said: ""People chose the best candidates in the 26 February and 29 April elections."" Friday's run-off election was held in constituencies where no candidate had won the minimum proportion of the vote in a first round in February.

An 18th woman was elected but her votes have been annulled by the Guardian Council, a constitutional oversight body. The election of a record number of women is a sign of a major shift in public support away from hard-line Islamic conservatives who have taken only 26% of seats - a dismal performance. Friday's vote gives women in Iran the same share of seats as in countries including Thailand and Nigeria.

In one case, a photograph of a teacher was posted online with an insulting word underneath. A third (33%) received remarks about their performance as a teacher, 9% had faced allegations from pupils about inappropriate behaviour and 8% had been subjected to threatening behaviour. ""The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers' health and well-being, and undermining their confidence to do their job."" Almost two-thirds (62%) said pupils had posted insulting comments, while just over a third (34%) said students had taken photos or videos without consent. The union said it had been told of a teacher receiving the comment ""I hope she gets cancer"", while the heavily pregnant worker had faced abusive remarks.","More teachers are facing abuse on social media, warns a teachers' union."

Former Hearts and Sunderland keeper Gordon started the first nine matches of the season but lost his place to summer recruit De Vries in mid-August. Having been the number one choice for the past two seasons, Gordon was playing after Dorus de Vries picked up an injury at the weekend. Asked how the match ranked in his long career, he replied: ""It's right up there. The 33-year-old goalkeeper was busy in a 3-3 draw, his first taste of the Champions League group stage.

""We'd have liked to get the three points but it was an incredible effort against a top quality side."" ""Everybody wants to be a part of nights like that. ""This is the highest level of club football and to finally manage that at the age of 33 is a special moment for me,"" said Gordon. ""I think I've done pretty well in stages this season and if I can get a run in the team then hopefully I can go from strength to strength."" ""If I've not been selected, that's the manager's decision and I fully respect that. ""The other side of that is that I want to play every game. De Vries was fit enough to be among the substitutes in a thriller with Manchester City in which Gordon made two good stops to deny Ilkay Gundogan, one late in the game from a deflected strike. There was a couple of times when I was absolutely screaming at Kolo [Toure] to leave the ball and he just couldn't hear me. Gordon was a half-time replacement in Saturday's win over Kilmarnock, with the 35-year-old Dutchman suffering a chest injury. ""I was happy with how I played - that's all I can do,"" he said.

204,33584638,"""The government checks the list of voters and if your name is not on the list, they will investigate it"", one North Korean defector told the NK News website. In the second provincial elections in 2003, one report said 26,650 ""officials, workers, peasants and intellectuals"" were elected. Abstaining or voting no are considered acts of treason. Sunday's elections are to decide provincial governors, mayors and local assemblies in the country of almost 25m people. Having such a high reported turnout has its advantages for the state, observers say, in that it acts as an informal census. Sunday's elections do not decide the leadership of the country. So why is it holding elections? And how reliable are they? Kim Jong-un won in the last parliamentary election in 2014 - gaining 100% of the vote in his Mount Paektu constituency. Parliamentary elections are also held in North Korea, and they decide who rules the country - which is always a foregone conclusion. In the last local election, in 2011, there was a turnout of 99.7%, with the state news agency saying those unable to vote were abroad or on the high seas. The number of seats is determined by each district's population. If the state works out you did not vote, NK News says, ""you and your family are in trouble"". The choice is limited - there is only one candidate on the ballot in each district, and while the selection of candidates is made by the governing coalition, they are closely overseen by Kim Jong-un's Workers' Party. Local elections have been held in North Korea since 1999 - let's not forget that the country's full name is, technically, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). ""It is often during election that the government finds out about defectors and people who have been missed."" Ahead of last year's elections to name deputies for the country's assembly, The Economist reported that voting did not take place in secret, and any dissenting votes must be placed in a separate ballot box.

Reports suggest the stand-off - involving dozens of ships - is continuing, with water cannon fire being exchanged. China and Manila are also at odds over overlapping territorial claims. Last week, several collisions were reported between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in disputed waters as the Vietnamese ships sought to prevent the installation of the Chinese drilling rig. Separately, in comments made at a meeting with the Singaporean foreign minister, Mr Kerry called the Chinese move an ""aggressive act"". On Sunday, anti-China protests took place in several Vietnamese cities. The Philippines is in the process of taking China to a UN court over its territorial claims. In a telephone call, US Secretary of State John Kerry told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi the US had ""strong concerns"" over recent developments. Beijing claims a U-shaped swathe of the South China Sea that covers areas other South East Asian nations say are their territory. Tensions between Beijing and Manila are also running high, after the Philippines arrested and then charged nine Chinese fishermen with poaching at a disputed shoal. In Monday's telephone call, Mr Kerry ""said China's introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was provocative"", US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

210,34118105,"The easing of the rules is being seen as a shift in Catholic Church policy, reflecting the Pope's outspoken views on compassion and mercy. The Pope has previously denounced abortion as part of a throw-away culture. ""'I have decided, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to allow all priests for the Jubilee Year to absolve of the sin of abortion those who procure it and who also seek forgiveness,"" Pope Francis said. However, he has not changed Church policy on contraception. The Jubilee Year runs from 8 December 2015 to 26 November 2016 and is seen as one of the Catholic Church's most important events. It normally takes place every 25 years unless a pope declares an extraordinary one to draw attention to a particular issue. ""It is horrific even to think that there are children, victims of abortion, who will never see the light of day,"" he said in 2014. In Catholicism, abortion is viewed as such a grave sin that it warrants automatic excommunication. Speaking earlier this year, Pope Francis said that although contraception remains forbidden, there was no need for people to breed ""like rabbits"" to be good Catholics. He added that he had ""met so many women who bear in their heart the scar of this agonising and painful decision"". In most countries, only a bishop can approve forgiveness for abortion. However, the rule relaxation will not affect Catholics in England, Wales and Scotland as all priests there can already forgive abortion without seeking permission from a bishop. ""Unfortunately, what is thrown away is not only food and dispensable objects, but often human beings themselves, who are discarded as unnecessary,"" he added. The Pope said many women who sought an abortion did so because they ""believe that they have no other option"". In 2013, on the topic of homosexuality, he said: ""Who am I to judge?"" However, in contrast to his predecessors, he regards compassion and mercy as virtues that outclass all others. Pope Francis is aware that the decision will not be welcomed by traditionalists, says the BBC's David Willey. The change is only for the coming Jubilee Year, beginning in December. Pope Francis has been viewed as progressive on other controversial issues. They would then delegate an expert priest to hear the confession.","Pope Francis is making it easier for women and doctors to seek forgiveness for abortion, by allowing all priests to forgive it."

On Wednesdy, Townshend was found not guilty of perjury and making a false record, after being accused of dishonestly claiming the dive was caused by a technical fault. Flt Lt Andrew Townshend cost the Ministry of Defence millions of pounds when he deactivated the autopilot of the military passenger jet. He also told the court that he had been viewing the star-filled sky moments before the incident, as he had a passion for star-gazing. Townshend pleaded guilty to negligently performing a duty and was also handed a four-month suspended prison sentence. Mr Lickley said: ""Their lives and health and welfare were put at significant risk by Flt Lt Townshend's negligence."" Judge Advocate Alan Large told Townshend: ""This was not a momentary lapse of concentration, your eye was well off the ball."" The Voyager aircraft, which had 198 passengers and crew on board, plummeted 4,400ft (1,341m) over the Black Sea. The court martial heard that during a flight from RAF Brize Norton to Afghanistan on 9 February 2014 the 49-year-old pilot's camera was pushed into the aircraft's control stick as he moved his seat, switching off the autopilot. A board of RAF officers at Bulford, Wiltshire, heard crew and passengers thought they were going to die during the flight, and some were thrown weightless into the air and smashed into the ceiling. The experienced pilot - who has served with the RAF for 30 years and completed 5,500 flying hours - had been using his camera to photograph other aircraft from the cockpit and had taken 95 shots that day. This led to service personnel being stranded in Afghanistan while they waited for the aircraft to be brought back into service, he added. Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, said the incident led to the grounding of the military fleet of six Voyager aircraft for 13 days while the cause of the nosedive was investigated.",An RAF pilot who caused his plane to nosedive while using a digital camera has been dismissed by a military court.

218,35160223,"She was found dead three days later. It has not yet been determined whether the police officer who arrested her should face charges, a prosecutor said. The 28-year-old African-American was arrested after a confrontation with a policeman who had pulled her car over. He unsuccessfully tries to pull her out and tells her ""I will light you up"". The Waller County grand jury would return in January to consider whether to indict police officer Brian Encinia, who arrested Ms Bland in July, prosecutor Darrell Jordan said. The family have denied that she was suicidal and have accused the jail of being ""reckless"" in disregarding her safety and failing to keep her free from harm. Video footage from the jail did not show what happened inside Ms Bland's cell, but did suggest no-one entered or left it until someone found her unconscious. An attorney representing Ms Bland's family, Cannon Lambert, said on Monday that the grand jury's decision was consistent with what the family believed was an attempt by authorities to cover up the events surrounding Ms Bland's death. Police say that Ms Bland hanged herself while being held in the Waller County jail. The jury ruled that neither sheriff's officials nor jailers committed a crime in their treatment of Bland. ""They continue to do things we are disappointed in,"" he said. Ms Bland died by asphyxiation after using a plastic bag to hang herself in her cell, according to Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathias. The situation quickly escalates, with Mr Encinia appearing to threaten Ms Bland after she refuses to get out of her car. In recent years, the deaths of black Americans in police custody have caused much debate and protests in the US. Mr Mathis has said there is nothing in that investigation ""that shows anything happened but she killed herself"". Ms Bland's family has alleged Mr Encinia falsified an assault allegation to take her into custody. Ms Bland's sister Shante Needham has said Sandra had called her from jail, saying she did not know why she had been arrested and that an officer had possibly broken her arm. A video of the arrest shows Mr Encinia giving Ms Bland a warning.","A grand jury has decided not to indict anyone in the case of Sandra Bland, who died in a Texas jail earlier this year."
219,34181122,"For Number 10, that action is distinct from its decision on whether to take military action and have RAF pilots join US forces flying bombing missions over Syria. In any case, isn't it entirely unusual, almost unheard of in modern times, for British military action to take the life of a British citizen? The answer to all three of those questions is yes. But this strike does add a sense of urgency to those making the arguments for intervention - a reminder that so-called IS plan and plot in Syria, that the direct threat to the UK is real and getting more serious. In the PM's view and, he says, the view of the government's most senior lawyer - the attorney general - that made the attack entirely proper and legal. ""There was a terrorist directing murder on our streets and no other means to stop him,"" the PM said. But there are calls tonight from opposition politicians for more information and reassurance on the particular circumstances around this attack, accusations already that the strike is evidence of British ""mission creep"". Didn't MPs vote against bombing Syria a couple of years ago? But just a couple of weeks ago, an unmanned British Reaper drone did drop a missile on a group of so-called IS fighters in Syria that killed two British citizens. The prime minister still wants to persuade MPs to back that plan this autumn, although a vote is unlikely until after the party conference season wraps up. Although we've been told repeatedly British drones have been flying over Syria to carry out surveillance, in the small print the government always retained the right to act in extremis without specific permission from MPs. One, the target, Reyaad Khan, was according to David Cameron involved in plotting a barbaric attack on British soil. As the operation appears to have been led by intelligence the truth is we may never know what really happened, what the precise circumstances were. But the fact that we know a British plane has dropped a British bomb in Syria, on British citizens may mean, earlier than expected, the battle lines in this debate are drawn. In the last few days haven't the prime minister and the chancellor made clear they would only take military action in Syria if there was a consensus here in the UK?",You might be surprised by this afternoon's news that British bombing killed British nationals in Syria in the last few weeks.
220,39577369,"He added that strong intellectual property protections would need to be included in trade talks with third party countries. Revenue from physical formats dipped below £300m last year, but remained just above the £274m generated by streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer. However, many argue that the Google-owned video site should pay out far more revenue to artists and songwriters. ""YouTube is contributing a meaningful and growing revenue stream for the industry."" Streaming revenues jumped more than 60% in 2016, and accounted for close to a third of label revenues. The BPI said streaming would overtake revenues from physical sales in 2017. However, more revenues could be generated by platforms such as Youtube, the BPI said. UK artists needed to be able to tour freely in EU markets, and UK businesses needed to be able to employ the best talent, Mr Taylor argued. An International Trade spokeswoman said: ""Music is one of our most important exports and trade policy has a key role in supporting growth in this market. Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the Brit Awards, said the increase in revenues was encouraging, as more and more consumers enjoyed the benefits of subscribing to a streaming service or rediscovered the joys of vinyl. Combined takings from streaming, downloads, physical sales and licensing for use in films, TV and computer games rose 5.1% to £926m. She said that YouTube had paid out more than $1bn to the music industry globally from advertising in the past year. The main contributor to growth was streaming, but vinyl revenues rose by more than two thirds. A YouTube spokesperson said it was working ""with the music industry to bring more money to artists, labels and publishers"". However, the association added that there was a ""growing mismatch between the huge value that certain digital platforms, such as YouTube, extract from music or other entertainment and the relatively small amount they return back to the creators concerned"". ""Britain's world-leading music sector has the potential for sustained growth in the years ahead, but this exciting future can only be realised if government makes creative businesses a priority post-Brexit,"" he added. ""We will in due course explore all options in the design of future trade agreements, including the role of intellectual property rights in boosting UK exports in overseas markets.""","Revenue for UK record companies hit a five-year high in 2016, according to industry association the BPI."
221,17337318,"Her tomb was of black marble, with gilded letters and decoration. Katharine of Aragon died at Kimbolton Castle in 1536, and was buried at the cathedral following a lavish funeral. It was not until the late 19th Century that a wife of one of the cathedral canons, Katharine Clayton, started a public appeal asking all the Katharines of England to donate to the replacement marble slab which can be seen today. This is one of a number of unusual stories to be told in the BBC's People's Passion, which explores the purpose of cathedrals today. ""Many of the population had a good deal of sympathy for Katharine after the divorce and felt she had been hard done by."" Stuart Orme, from Vivacity Heritage which co-organises the Katharine of Aragon Festival, said: ""She was revered for her piety and dignity. She had chosen the fruit when she was still a princess in Spain because to the medieval world it symbolised fertility. A representative of the Spanish embassy is invited to a civic service on the Friday and a Catholic mass is held on the Saturday. The cathedral now marks the funeral date with the Katharine of Aragon Festival on the Friday and Saturday nearest the 29 January. Flowers, and Katharine's heraldic symbol, the pomegranate, are laid upon her tomb. Hundreds of children are encouraged to dress in Tudor costume, and learn how people lived in the early 16th Century from historic re-enactors. Katharine was cast aside by Henry VIII for being unable to provide the Tudor dynasty with a male heir. Mr Orme said: ""But Oliver Cromwell's soldiers stole the gilding during the sack of the cathedral in 1643, while a dean of the cathedral used the marble for the floor of his summerhouse in the 1700s."" A festival marks the anniversary of her death and a Catholic mass is celebrated - a rarity in an Anglican cathedral. Despite living in reduced circumstances after the end of her marriage, she was given an elaborate funeral on 29 January 1536, involving four bishops and six abbots.",The connection between Peterborough Cathedral and Henry VIII's Spanish queen is little known outside the city.
222,30260834,"Kurdish sources said the bomber had crossed from Turkey, but Turkish officials denied this as ""lies"". The first of the attacks was near the Turkish border crossing. The first suicide vehicle bomb targeted a Kurdish position close to the Turkish border at dawn on Saturday. Meanwhile two US-led air strikes were carried out against IS positions in the east of Kobane. Clashes followed at the site of the attack and to the south-west of the town. The UK-based activist group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said there were three more suicide bombings - one an individual with a suicide vest and the other two vehicle bombs. However, Turkey views Kurdish forces with suspicion, following a decade-long battle for autonomy by its own Kurdish minority. They have been supported by a small number of well-armed Iraqi Kurdish fighters, some other Syrian opposition units, and of course by the coalition air strikes. IS militants launched at least four suicide attacks, with reports saying at least 25 people were killed. But the Kurdish fighters have defended tenaciously and kept hold of roughly half the town. It is thought to be the first fighting in that area. Turkey has allowed some Kurdish fighters from Iraq to travel through its territory to assist in defending Kobane. The US-led coalition is supporting the town's defenders with air strikes. As the clashes intensified, there were reports that IS had brought up tanks to join the fighting. IS controls large swathes of both Syria and neighbouring Iraq. But it has met stiff resistance from local Kurdish fighters, who have held about half the town assisted by small numbers of Iraqi Kurds and Syrian Arabs, and backed by US-led air strikes. In all, 25 people were killed in the clashes, most of them IS fighters, reports said. In the early stages, it looked as though the town's fall was only a matter of time. The militants have been trying to overrun Kobane for the past two months. IS has captured parts of the town and dozens of villages in the area around it in an offensive lasting more than two months. The battle for Kobane has left hundreds of people dead and forced more than 200,000 to flee into Turkey.","Fighting has intensified in the besieged Syrian border town of Kobane, where Kurdish forces have been holding Islamic State at bay since September."

By the time the helmsman noticed the vessel was turning the collision could not be prevented, the MAIB said. The MAIB said the mate did not take immediate action to avoid the vessel's collision with Redoubt because he thought the motor tug was turning towards Millennium Time, but Millennium Time had unexpectedly steered towards the motor tug. The report said: ""The turn was not deliberately initiated by the movement of the helm and most likely resulted from the unintended application of port rudder, and/or the influence of the effects of (an aquatic phenomenon known as) hydrodynamic interaction."" Both vessels were damaged and it took 32 days to repair Millennium Time's damage, which included broken windows. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said it was difficult to keep the vessel Millennium Time on a steady heading before it struck a tug on the River Thames in July 2014. The MAIB, which made a number of safety recommendations, said City Cruises had replaced the steering systems on Millennium Time and its sister vessels. The report added the crew were also unaware of the number of passengers onboard - they thought they were carrying 426 people but the police counted 362. The report also said the man at the helm at the time of the crash did not hold a boatmaster's licence. ""The report does not highlight one significant reason for the accident and refers to a number of contributing factors."" The nine injured passengers suffered cuts and bruises when the boat struck motor tug Redoubt, which was towing three barges between Blackfriars and Waterloo bridges on the Thames on 17 July 2014. The 69-year-old mate's employment as a helmsman was contrary to the instructions of the Millennium Time's operators, City Cruises, the report said. And the 58-year-old master of vessel was providing a sightseeing commentary, meaning he did not supervise the mate at the helm, the report concluded. In a statement, City Cruises said its vessels undergo rigorous testing and the helmsman was in the process of completing his boatmaster's licence. City Cruises apologised and said passenger safety was ""paramount"".","A pleasure boat involved in a crash that injured nine tourists had steering problems, a report has said."

229,36828072,"The Welsh Government figures showed that in six of the seven health boards in Wales, the number of district nurses has fallen between 2009 and 2015. She also claimed district nurses have seen a big increase in their caseloads over the past few years, from around 30 patients to 150. ""This is largely because health boards are keen to develop a more effective skills mix at local level, using highly experienced district nurses to direct, lead and advise community nursing teams,"" he said. In 2015, there were 412 district nurses in Wales, down 42% from 712 in 2009, figures have shown. It said it was concerned the move to look after more people at home could have affected the care people receive. ""With regards to outcomes for patients, the recently launched NHS Outcomes and Delivery Framework 2016-17 - which was developed through engagement with patients, clinicians and stakeholders - identifies key outcomes and priority areas the NHS  must be measured against. A Welsh Government spokesman said while the number of district nurses had fallen, the overall number of nurses providing community services had increased by 17% over the past six years, from 3,338 full time equivalent community nursing staff in 2009 to 3,915 in 2015. The Welsh Government said overall, the total number of nurses providing community services had increased. Only staffing at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board remained at the same level it was six years ago. ""The framework has been balanced to ensure that all aspects of care are represented, including care provided in the community."" In hospitals, outcomes are measured - such as with waiting lists -  but there are less ways to judge nursing care received at home, it added. Tina Donnelly, director of the RCN in Wales, said it has ""undoubtedly"" contributed to to GP waiting times and possibly re-admissions to hospitals, as more care is given in the community. The Royal College of Nursing said it was placing pressure on GP surgeries and emergency departments. The RCN said it wanted more information gathered about outcomes for people being nursed at home instead of in hospital. ""That beggars belief in terms of the absolute contact time that nurse will be able to spend with that patient,"" she said. District nurses are senior, experienced nurses sometimes compared to being the GPs of nursing and clinically supervise less experienced staff or those with fewer qualifications, such as health care workers.","The number of district nurses in Wales has fallen to its lowest level in six years, prompting concern patients who are cared for at home could be at risk."
230,25744060,"But potentially that is just the tip of the iceberg. A review by NHS England into the A&E system, which was published in November, said pharmacies were an ""under-used"" resource that if tapped into could take the pressure off GPs who in turn would then have time to take on some of the workload of hospitals. But despite their expanding remit, much of the public is oblivious. Making sure the potential of pharmacies is realised could also have important implications for the rest of the health service too. If that was to happen it could have a profound effect on the entire NHS. Less than a third of people asked in a recent YouGov poll of over 2,000 people were aware of what pharmacists could offer. It means many now offer blood pressure checks, and cholesterol and blood glucose level tests alongside pregnancy testing and sexually transmitted infection services. It is running a two-year promotional campaign, Dispensing Health, to promote what the UK's 13,000 community pharmacies can do. Over the past decade or so pharmacists have been given more and more responsibilities in the NHS, just as nurses have. ""Yet people still don't really know who we are and what we can do."" Dr Mike Dixon, of the NHS Alliance, says: ""Community pharmacy is perfectly positioned to take the strain from GPs and A&E departments that are bursting at the seams."" So now Pharmacy Voice, which represents the industry, is launching a drive to change perceptions. ""Pharmacy is the third largest health profession (in the health sector) after medicine and nursing,"" says Pharmacy Voice chief executive Prof Robert Darracott. It is thought as many as one in seven GP appointments could be dealt with by pharmacies - about 40m a year. The push has received the backing of GPs with both the Royal College of GPs and NHS Alliance, which represents community services, putting their names to the campaign. Colds and flu can often be dealt with there, without bothering a GP at all, while some even provide stop smoking services and prescribe drugs and treatments. He says the aim of the campaign is to ""challenge the traditional view of pharmacies as simply dispensers of medicine"" so that they are seen as a place where illness can be treated and good health promoted.","To many people, their local pharmacy is the place where they pick up their medicines and perhaps their toiletries."
231,35794194,"""The international community will pay a high price if we don't stand together to face this serious problem,"" he told the Global Education and Skills Forum. But he warned that Syria's neighbours did not have the capacity to deal with such an influx of families without more international assistance. Tom Fletcher, UK ambassador to Lebanon until last year, said the numbers of refugees were now ""staggering"". ""If we leave these students, we believe they could become extremists."" There had been financial support from the international community - and more had been pledged, Mr Thneibat said - but almost two-thirds of the cost of each extra refugee pupil was being taken from Jordan's own education budget, he said. He said Jordan was training thousands more teachers and building new schools, which would operate in double shifts to try to accommodate 145,000 refugee children in its state school system. This was in addition to extra costs in health, housing and infrastructure. George Papendreou, former prime minister of Greece, told the conference that he had been a refugee when his family was in political exile. But there were still more children arriving than could be taught, he warned. He said that European countries should try to see refugees as potential benefits to their societies rather than respond with ""fear and ignorance"". He called for more international financial support to help build schools and train teachers. He said conventional humanitarian crisis approaches did not work on this scale, and that other groups, including business, should contribute. Mohammad Thneibat said countries such as Jordan faced a ""serious problem"" in coping with so many young refugees. ""We're trying to do everything to educate these young people for peace, introducing ideas of tolerance and co-existence,"" Mr Thneibat, who is also Jordan's education minister, told the international conference in Dubai. Without any access to education, he said such youngsters could become part of another cycle of conflict. Mr Thneibat said Jordan already had Palestinian and Iraqi refugees and now had 1.3 million Syrians who had fled across its borders. Mr Fletcher is now working for a coalition trying to get business support to tackle the refugee crisis. ""The alternatives are very bad,"" said Mr Thneibat.","A failure to provide education for refugees escaping the conflict in Syria risks creating a future generation of extremists, the deputy prime minister of Jordan has warned."

Caffrey, of Sandesquoy, Tankerness, Orkney, taught at 10 schools in the county in a career spanning more than three decades. One of the rape victims went to the police 22 years ago but no charges were brought due to a lack of evidence, the court heard. Det Con Rob Smith, of Nottinghamshire Police, added: ""Caffrey believed that he would be able to put his past behind him, but...it has been shown that the passage of time is no hindrance to justice taking its course."" Michael Evans, defending Caffrey, said: ""He was a teacher for a number of years and, outside of these offences, a very good teacher."" One ex-pupil was raped six times by Caffrey at his home during a ""campaign of rape"", Nottingham Crown Court heard.

Police began investigating him after a victim, who said she was raped when she was nine years old, contacted officers in December 2012. Judge Timothy Spencer QC said: ""You deliberately targeted these girls, you calculated that they were ripe for this sort of abuse and you calculated that they would not tell.

Former nurse Vasco-Knight, of Runcorn, Cheshire, shook and sobbed uncontrollably as she changed her plea to one of the two charges of fraud she faced. She used £11,072 of NHS cash to pay her husband Stephen, 46, for work on an equality and diversity publication called Transform, which never existed. Mr Naqvi, 28, of Bristol, was cleared of two counts of aiding and abetting. Vasco-Knight was CEO at the South Devon NHS Foundation Trust and the national lead for equalities for NHS England when the offence occurred. Recorder Don Tait adjourned sentence until March but warned the Vasco-Knights that a ""custodial sentence is a distinct possibility"". The prosecution offered no evidence on the second fraud charge against Mrs Vasco-Knight of swindling £9,000 from the NHS. Paula Vasco-Knight, 53, broke down as she changed her plea on the second day of her trial at Exeter Crown Court. He told the jury: ""As far as Mrs Vasco-Knight is concerned, she has fallen a long way, hasn't she, but that is her responsibility."" Sue Frith, managing director of NHS Protect, which conducted the investigation, said Vasco-Knight's meteoric career path had been ""an inspiration to so many"" and her fraud was a ""huge disappointment and shock to many"". Vasco-Knight later tried to blame Habib Naqvi, a senior manager in the NHS, for commissioning the newsletter. He said Vasco-Knight's failure to declare an interest in Thinking Caps was a criminal offence and a ""massive breach of trust and abuse of her position as chief executive"". Her husband also changed his plea to admit fraud. The newsletter was commissioned by her in April 2013 and produced by her husband's firm Thinking Caps that July, the court heard. But it was a ""sham"", cut and pasted from a research paper by the Kings Fund charity, said Gareth Evans, prosecuting.","A former NHS equality boss has been warned she could face jail for swindling £11,000 by diverting funds to her husband."
235,32118803,"Their chemistry, geology and biology will be analysed to build up a record of how the annual Indian monsoon cycle has historically been affected by climate change. Some of the samples came from sites that had never been drilled before. Palaeoclimatology - the study of changes in climate taken on the scale of the entire history of Earth - can give valuable clues to how the Earth might respond to future climate change. This results in 75% of the year's rain falling between June and September. Dr Littler was part of an expedition to the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea on a scientific drill ship belonging to the UK International Ocean Discovery Program. Simulations of future climate generally suggest a 5-10% increase in monsoon rainfall over India, which could influence the economy and agriculture. Others contained volcanic ashes, which can be matched to ancient volcanic eruptions, helping in dating the sediments. The team of international scientists collected sediment samples from the deep-sea at several locations. ""We wanted to capture the whole evolution of the India monsoon from when it intensified about 8 million years ago,"" said Dr Littler. Samples drilled from beneath the Indian Ocean are being used to reconstruct past rainfall and temperature records. ""The data will give us a holistic idea of the past behaviour of the monsoon."" These are being analysed to reconstruct what the regional and global climate was like during the period when the small fossilised marine creatures contained in the sediments lived. Scientists are studying how the Indian monsoon behaved in the past, to shed light on the impact of climate change. ""By analysing these hard-to-reach deep-sea sediments we will make important discoveries about the behaviour of the Indian monsoon in the deep past, and how its behaviour and intensity may change in the near future. As part of the larger-scale Asian monsoon, the monsoon over India is formed due to intense heat from the Sun in late spring, which warms the Northern Indian Ocean, along with the plains of northern India and the Tibetan Plateau. The research will lead to a better understanding of how the monsoon over India might change, said Dr Kate Littler of the University of Exeter.",Fossils from the ocean floor are yielding clues to the Indian monsoon millions of years ago.
236,39251585,"Mr Turnbull said more needed to be done, citing the case of a baby who died from whooping cough. Widespread vaccination also reduces the risk of infection to those who, for medical reasons, may not be able to receive the vaccine themselves. But as the numbers of those without protection rises, so to does the risk to each of them - something which happened alongside the first death from measles in the United States in 12 years. And so it protects those few without the vaccine. The so-called ""anti-vax"" movement believes vaccinations may cause medical conditions such as autism, but overwhelming scientific research suggests this is not the case. Vaccines can cause adverse reactions in a small number of people, like many medicines, but the accepted science is that the benefits far outweigh the risks. ""If a parent says, 'I'm not going to vaccinate my child,' they are not simply putting their child at risk, they are putting everybody else's children at risk too."" An Australian Child Health Poll survey of nearly 2,000 parents showed 5% of children were not fully vaccinated. Three Australian states - Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria - already require children to be immunised, or be on an approved catch-up programme, to enrol in childcare centres. ""If you, as a parent, expect the community to support you by either welfare payments or access to care, then you need to do your bit to contribute to that community by protecting other children,"" he told Fairfax Media. ""This is not a theoretical exercise - this is life and death,"" Mr Turnbull said. It stops the spread of disease by preventing an infection from moving among most people - the ones who have been vaccinated. So-called ""herd immunity"" is an important part of public health programmes. Vaccinating children is not a legal requirement in Australia, but failing to do so makes parents ineligible for childcare rebates. Health groups have supported the push, arguing parents and the community have an obligation to protect children. Australian Medical Association president Michael Gannon said children were more susceptible to infections. Some Australian states already have ""no jab, no play"" laws, but PM Malcolm Turnbull is calling for nationwide legislation.",Unvaccinated children would be banned from childcare centres and preschools under an Australian government plan.

UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov said the figures were ""a worrying reversal in efforts"". The Afghan government has a stated policy of eradicating poppy crops, but the crop is widespread in many government-controlled regions, and officials are often accused of turning a blind eye. The Taliban also taxes poppy production in areas it controls, which is a major source of income for its military activities. Just 355 hectares (877 acres) of poppies were eradicated by provincial authorities in the last year - down more than  90% since 2015, when almost 4,000 hectares were cleared. Earlier this year, the BBC's South Asia correspondent Justin Rowlatt visited poppy farms in the north-east, where one farmer told him the local government knew about his crop, but ""they also know it is the only way anyone can make decent money."" Growing opium is a crime in the country, but it is still a major cash crop for impoverished farming communities. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said the area used to farm the poppy plant, the source of opium, increased by 10% to 201,000 hectares. The opium produced from the poppy plant is used to make some of the most powerful medicinal painkillers, such as morphine. However, many nations cultivate their own supply for medicinal use, and Afghanistan's production of illicit opium is primarily sued for the illegal drug trade. Taliban militants launched a fresh assault on the Helmand regional capital of Lashkar Gah in early October. The southern region of the country is the most productive area, accounting for 54% of the entire national opium production. The region was a contested area between the Taliban and Nato-led forces, before the latter withdrew in 2014. Seven insurgents and one officer died during attacks on eradication teams this year. Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of the substance, which is the main ingredient in heroin. Helmand province, which has seen a resurgent Taliban presence, is the single largest producer, with more than 80,000 hectares of poppy cultivation.","Opium production in Afghanistan has increased by 43% in the past year, United Nations officials have said."

But British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter said while he supported increasing the skills of the workforce, this should not be done ""at the expense of good quality training for doctors or indeed doctors themselves"".

The think tank highlighted examples of areas that were already experimenting. And Unison head of health Christina McAnea said the squeeze on funding in the health service meant there was ""all too often"" no funding for training courses. ""There should be more staff support for doctors to help them coordinate the best possible care for their patients."" ""Developing the NHS support workforce must not be seen as a quick and cheap fix for the chronic shortages of nurses and other health workers across the country,"" she added. ""It takes doctors many years to learn how to provide the best care for their patients, and there is no substitute for this kind of expertise and experience,"" he said. NHS Employers asked the Nuffield Trust to look at ways the 1.3 million-strong workforce could be reshaped to help. Are nurses the new doctors? These included:
The report said as well as helping cover for doctor shortages, such moves made sense because of the changing nature of care, with much more stress on looking after people with long-term conditions such as diabetes and heart disease rather than curing them. NHS short of front-line staff, MPs say
Report author Candace Imison said there were ""huge opportunities"" in reshaping the workforce, in both improving patient care and providing staff with more rewarding roles. It said that as doctors only made up about one in 10 of the workforce much more was needed from other health staff, but the Nuffield Trust admitted money would need to be set aside to ensure it happened.","Nurses, paramedics and pharmacists should be trained to fill in for doctors and help the NHS in England cope with demand, bosses say."

An European Union source told the BBC that last six-month payment was being withheld over ""accounting issues"". The head of Amisom told the BBC the correct papers to account for the last tranche had now been submitted. In the past 12 months four Amisom bases manned by Burundian, Ugandan, Kenyan and Ethiopian troops have been attacked by the militants. Ugandan military chief General Katumba Wamala said he unable to describe the extent of his frustration over the late payments. The EU provides $1,028 (Â£700) for each Amisom soldier each month; their respective governments then deduct around $200 for administrative costs meaning the soldiers are supposed to take home about $800. So soldiers are now receiving money owed to them last year but have not received any of it owed to them this year. The 22,000-strong African Union force (Amisom) fighting the Islamist militant group al-Shabab is funded by the EU. Uganda joined Amisom in 2007 and is the force's biggest contributor, with more than 6,000 troops. The BBC understands there have been delays over the last two tranches - and last year's June-November payment has only just arrived. Kenya has never confirmed how many soldiers it lost in the attack and African Union does not release full casualty figures. Burundian military officials also said their troops had not been paid. EU ambassador to Somalia Michele Cervone d'Urso said he was ""concerned about the delay"" in the stipend which he said was ""essential for the motivation of soldiers"". According to the Somali president, 180 Kenyan troops being killed in a single incident in January. Gen Wamala also said that Uganda would pull its soldiers out of Somalia by December 2017, because of frustrations with the Somali army and military advisers from the US, UK and Turkey. Amisom officials fear that the late payments are having a negative impact have on troop morale. This deployment allowance is much more than the meagre salaries the soldiers receive from their governments. ""These papers are on their way; the money is also on its way,"" Francisco Madeira said.","The allowances for African troops fighting al-Qaeda-linked militants in Somalia have not been paid for at least six months, the BBC has learned."

The Saudi authorities had imposed power cuts on residents to try to make them leave, said the UN Special Rapporteur on housing, Leilani Farha. During the protests, activists have accused security forces of opening fire on demonstrators, and say others are being jailed or sentenced to death for protest-related crimes. Anti-government demonstrations in Eastern Province began after the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, and protests and attacks have become more frequent since the January 2016 execution of the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr. In July, Saudi Arabia executed four people accused of carrying out terrorist acts in the Qatif region. The authorities have been trying since May to demolish the old quarter of Awamiya, saying Shia militants use its narrow streets as a hideout. At least seven people, including two police officers, have been killed in the clashes, Reuters news agency said. In the same month, two members of the Saudi security forces were killed in separate bombings in Awamiya. People in the town were running out of drinking water, he added. Shia residents of the region around the city of Qatif have long complained that they are marginalised and discriminated against by the Sunni monarchy. In June, another officer and two other people died in bombings. Local activists say Saudi forces have been firing randomly towards homes and cars, and that buildings have been damaged or burned in the fighting. Activists accuse security forces of trying to force out residents. ""No one is going out. If you go out, you will be shot by snipers,"" one activist told the BBC.

Many of these incidents happen at Farewell Spit. New Zealand has one of the highest stranding rates in the world, with about 300 dolphins and whales ending up on beaches every year, according to Project Jonah.. But it sometimes happens because the whales are old and sick, injured, or make navigational errors particularly along gentle sloping beaches. Experts say its shallow waters seems to confuse whales and hinder their ability to navigate. Andrew Lamason, the departments regional manager, said it was one of the largest mass beachings recorded in New Zealand. About 300 have already died at Farewell Spit, on the South Island, in one of the worst such cases in the country. It said the surviving whales are ""being kept cool, calm and comfortable"" by medics and members of the public. Some of the refloated whales tried to swim back to shore, and the human chain was trying to herd them out to deeper waters, said volunteer Ana Wiles. Scientists do not know what exactly causes whales to beach themselves. ""We managed to float quite a few whales off and there were an awful lot of dead ones in the shallows so it was really, really sad."" ""One of the nicest things was we managed to float off a couple [of whales] and they had babies and the babies were following,"" Ms Wiles added. In February 2015 about 200 whales beached themselves at the same location, of which at least half died. Hundreds of locals and conservation department staff have been trying to save the survivors since early Friday morning, and have formed a human chain to refloat the whales. Sometimes when one whale is beached, it will send out a distress signal attracting other members of its pod, who then also get stranded by a receding tide. which is leading efforts to save the whales said a total of 416 whales were stranded.",Volunteers in New Zealand are racing to rescue survivors after more than 400 pilot whales beached themselves.

The Oil and Gas Technology centre will invest in small firms with solid ideas and help pair some of those developers with the offshore operators that need them. Prof Phil Hassard said: ""They'll be able to get the results back from that... they can be tested here and are more cost effective than trying to do it on a real rig."" They will now be able to incorporate new technologies into their models to see if they work effectively. The new centre will build on the existing work being carried out by Aberdeen's two universities. Chief executive Colette Cohen said: ""We have much more operators in the north sea now, I think it's about 60 operators whereas back in the 80s it was about five or six, so it is a hugely different world. ""So this is a time when we can provide that service to them."" It said this happened after many production platforms were sold by the big oil majors to much smaller firms. Managing director Tim Walsh said: ""What we are hoping and expecting from the technology centre is that it will allow us as an organisation that has solutions to particular problems that we know exist to get a better connection with end users and clients and get more traction. ""We want them to allow us to take them out into the field, give us the opportunity to demonstrate to potential clients that the technology works and that the technology can actually allow them to do what we want them to do.""

Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said Todt and Ecclestone refused to revert to the 2015 system despite teams' wishes to do so. A compromise has been put on the table now for the teams to consider. A new aggregate system proposed by the FIA will be discussed again next week. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said all parties had agreed that the new system introduced on the eve of the 2016 season - where the slowest car is eliminated every 90 seconds in three sessions - was not the way forward. Horner said: ""There is an unwillingness from the promoter and FIA to go back to 2015. Ecclestone has made it clear he wants to find a way to shuffle the grids so that the fastest cars are not always at the front. ""Let's have a look at what's been out on the table today. Horner said that the proposal was for a reversion to the 2015 format, but with each drivers' two fastest laps being counted towards their grid position rather than just their fastest. Horner and Wolff both said they did not know why Ecclestone and Todt were so opposed to reverting to the 2015 system, whereby all eligible cars ran to the end of a session before the slowest few in each are knocked out, gradually reducing the number of cars over the three sessions. The teams would go back. Todt said in a news conference on Saturday that race promoters had asked for a different system because they feared the 2015 approach was not exciting enough. Teams discussed the failure of the new elimination format with F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone and Jean Todt, president of governing body, the FIA. Lewis Hamilton qualified fastest for Sunday's race in Bahrain, but there were quiet periods near the end of the first and second sessions when there were no cars out on the track.",Formula 1 bosses have failed to agree on a new format for qualifying after a meeting at the Bahrain Grand Prix.
262,33098672,"Management said they had been left with no choice after a midnight closing time was imposed on its nightclub by the city's licensing board. She added: ""Aside from the fact that the Arches is one of Glasgow's most cultural venues, this is obviously a very worrying time for the staff facing redundancy. ""Creative Scotland agreed with Glasgow Life and Glasgow City Council to bring forward some of this year's support for the Arches - £92,000 from Creative Scotland and £37,000 from Glasgow City Council - to assist with the delivery of the current arts programme in the short-term. Sandra White, the SNP MSP for Glasgow Kelvin, raised the plight of the venue at First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament, where Deputy First Minister John Swinney was standing in for Nicola Sturgeon during her trip to the US. The Arches announced on Wednesday that it had gone into administration. ""I reassure Sandra White that we will look in all ways that we possibly can do to assist in safeguarding the future of what I recognise as a significant cultural venue in the city of Glasgow and a venue that contributes a great deal to the cultural life of Scotland."" The restriction followed police complaints about drug abuse and disorder. ""Can the deputy first minister assure those affected that the Scottish Government will offer all the support that it can?"" The Arches has received £11.2m of public funding, including £3.8m of capital funding, through Creative Scotland and previously the Scottish Arts Council over the past 20 years. Ms White said 130 jobs had been put at risk by the Arches going into administration. The Scottish government has also said staff potentially affected the Arches going into administration would be supported through the Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (Pace) initiative. Mr Swinney replied: ""Creative Scotland is working hard with the organisation and with other partners to explore options regarding the future of arts programming of this nature in Glasgow. It was said to have cut total revenues at the Arches by more than 50%, making it untenable as a business. Ms White said she was now calling on Glasgow City Council, Police Scotland and the management of the Arches to get round the table and ""see what can be done to either reverse the closure or see what can be done to reopen the doors as soon as possible"".",The Scottish government has said it will examine what it can do to help safeguard the future of Glasgow's troubled Arches arts venue.
263,34423371,"However a number of pre-conditions would need to be met before a draft lease could be agreed, at the authority's February meeting. Mr Littlejohn also noted in his report that Historic Scotland had underlined that ""the process cannot be allowed to perpetuate"", and that a decision will have to be made. A report to councillors ahead of Wednesday's full council meeting noted that ""there has been a change in circumstances which significantly impacts upon the Seventy Group's bid"", meaning no further information could be provided. Should this happen, a draft lease could potentially be considered by the council in February 2016, although this would also have to be signed off by the Perth Common Good Fund Committee. Decisions over its future have been drawn out over a decade since then, with councillors at one point approving plans to have it demolished, which were subsequently blocked by Historic Scotland opposition. Councillors deferred a decision on which development bid to back, if any, in July, calling for further reports from Historic Scotland and other agencies and further information from the applicants. Five bids were submitted in January, which where whittled down to two by July when councillors deferred the decision. Councillors are to meet next week to consider bids to turn the hall into a food market or a hotel, with council officials backing the food hall plan. At that stage, council officials had backed the view of independent property specialists Jones Laing LaSalle that the Perth Market Place Ltd proposal should be preferred to the hotel bid from the Seventy Group. The Edwardian building, which dates back to 1911, was closed 10 years ago after a modern new concert hall was opened in the city. The development management committee then backed the Seventy Group plans to convert it into a luxury hotel, before councillors agreed to publicly market a 125-year lease on the building to find an alternative to demolition. Should neither bid ultimately win approval, demolition could still be an option, although Historic Scotland chief executive Ian Walford warned he would be minded to object to such a move. Planning and development head David Littlejohn has asked councillors to give the marketplace proposal ""preferred bidder status"" to allow detailed negotiations to take place. The B-listed Edwardian building has sat empty since it closed 10 years ago.",A decision on the future of demolition-threatened Perth City Hall will not be made until February 2016.

""I would say I feel more South African than British,"" said MacKenzie, who was born in the coastal town of Jeffreys Bay. I have a British passport, but I can't really forget I was born in Africa and my parents were. ""It will open a lot of doors for me,"" the former British senior squad member told BBC Look East. MacKenzie, who is now based at the Centurion Gymnastics Centre, intends to continue working with his Huntingdon coach Paul Hall and will send videos of his progress to receive tuition. I think it's definitely an achievable ambition to win the African champs, but there will be stiff competition.""

The 20-year-old was born in the Eastern Cape province, but his family moved to England when he was nine. He had trained with Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith at Huntingdon Gym, but believes returning home will improve his Olympic prospects. He has also represented the senior squad at national level, but the prospect of competing for Team GB at major international events was being restricted by the country's world-class roster, with Smith, Max Whitlock, Sam Oldham, Kristian Thomas and Dan Keatings all rivals for selection. ""I won a competition for GB in South Africa in 2010. And he will compete in the Africa championships at the end of March, in the hope of making the qualifying scores needed to become the first South African artistic gymnast to go to the Olympics since 1956. ""I've been here 11 years. MacKenzie is a European junior team gold medallist with Britain and finished second in the vault and sixth in the all-around at last year's national championships. I remember standing up there on the podium with the British anthem playing and thought it didn't quite feel right.

Jamie Murray boosted his hopes of hanging on to the doubles world number one spot for a while longer as he and Brazil's Bruno Soares reached the semi-finals.

It was a much improved performance from Murray, who broke 10th seed Raonic's serve five times. The Scot, 28, dominated all aspects of the game but was especially aggressive on the return, denying the big-serving Raonic a single ace and breaking five times. ""I was getting a good read on the serve and, when he missed the first serve, I was being very offensive on the second serve return and putting him under pressure. The pair beat sixth seeds Rohan Bopanna and Florin Mergea 6-2 6-3, despite Murray requiring treatment on his thigh at one stage.
