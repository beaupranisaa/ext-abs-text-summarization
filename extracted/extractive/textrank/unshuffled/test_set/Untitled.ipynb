Cotton, 69, a former England and British and Irish Lions prop returned to Sale - a club he served as both a player and director - after Simon Orange\\'s takeover of the Premiership side in June. He has promised to be active in his role, despite his commitments with his clothing business. \"That is my motivation for giving up the precious thing that I have got, and that is my time. \"I think what was lacking before was that the board weren\\'t very often represented at games home and away, and I think that is very wrong - board members will travel to away games and home games.\" Diamond also confirmed they are close to signing a new full-back and are still looking for another player to add to their backline, with former Bath and London Welsh winger Nick Scott on trial with the club.'"
