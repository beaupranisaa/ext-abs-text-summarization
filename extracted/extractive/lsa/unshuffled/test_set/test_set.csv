0,32300397,"The move is in response to an £8m cut in the subsidy received from the Department of Employment and Learning (DEL). The cut in undergraduate places will come into effect from September 2015. Job losses will be among both academic and non-academic staff and Queen's says no compulsory redundancies should be required. There are currently around 17,000 full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students at the university, and around 3,800 staff. Queen's has a current intake of around 4,500 undergraduates per year. The university aims to reduce the number of student places by 1,010 over the next three years. The BBC understands that there are no immediate plans to close departments or courses, but that the cuts in funding may put some departments and courses at risk. The Education Minister Stephen Farry said he recognised that some students might now choose to study in other areas of the UK because of the cuts facing Northern Ireland's universities. ""Some people will now be forced to look to opportunities in other parts of Great Britain and may not return to our economy,"" he said. ""Defunding our investment in skills, particularly at a time when we're trying to grow the economy does not make a lot of sense. What's happening is we're going backwards. ""The loss of any place is damaging to our economy, all subjects teach our young people critical skills."" Queen's vice-chancellor Patrick Johnston said the cuts had the potential to damage the reputation of the university. ""The potential negative impact, not just on the university but on the local economy is very significant,"" he said. ""It's the last thing we want to do, but we have to begin to focus on those areas where we can grow the organisation and develop it - it's clear we can no longer depend on the public purse to fund tuition. ""If we're not competitive we will not attract the best students, and we will not attract the best staff."" Just under £100m, a third of the university's income, comes from the Northern Ireland Executive. DEL's budget was reduced by £62m earlier this year, and its budget for higher education institutions fell from £203m to £186m, a reduction of 8.2%. Ulster University announced in February that it was dropping 53 courses. It will be cutting jobs and student places, but it has not yet revealed how many.","The cut in undergraduate places will come into effect from September 2015.

West Sussex chief fire officer Sean Ruth said the recovery operation was ""extremely challenging"" for crews. Sussex Police have also finished their work at the scene, but their investigations are continuing. Mr Ruth said the fire service had been ""truly humbled"" by the messages of support it had received. ""The thoughts and prayers of everyone at West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service continue to be with the families and friends of those killed and injured in the Shoreham Air Show tragedy,"" he said. He anticipated that Friday would be the last day his crews worked at the scene and wanted to thank people for the ""over-whelming support we have received"". ""In my 27 years of service I have never experienced such an outpouring of gratitude and respect as I have received on behalf of West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service over the last few weeks - from letters and emails, to words of thanks in the street, and from visitors at a number of our local fire stations,"" he said. Det Chief Insp Carwyn Hughes, of Sussex Police, said: ""Our officers and staff have been meticulous and have worked hard over the past three weeks to find answers for the victims' families. ""We have now finished work on the A27, however our investigation continues."" On Thursday, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it wanted to interview 51-year-old pilot Andy Hill as soon as possible. Reports that Mr Hill, a former RAF pilot from Sandon, near Buntingford in Hertfordshire, had left hospital have not been confirmed by police. An initial AAIB report said Mr Hill was thrown clear of the aircraft during the later part of the crash, but it is not clear whether he initiated his ejection. After the crash, the pilot's family issued a statement which said they were devastated and deeply saddened by the loss of life and sent prayers and heartfelt condolences to the families of all those affected. West Sussex County Council said the single closed westbound lane of the A27 was expected to be reopened to traffic next week but screens will stay up on the roadside indefinitely for reclamation work on the land to be completed.","West Sussex chief fire officer Sean Ruth said the recovery operation was ""extremely challenging"" for crews.

2,37427024,"The world's biggest clothing retailer posted net earnings of €1.26bn (£1.1bn) in the six months to 31 July - up 8% on the same period last year. Sales jumped from €9.4bn to €10.5bn, an increase of 11%. The group's clothes can now be bought online in around 40 countries, it said. Inditex operates eight brands in 90 countries including Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti and Bershka. How Zara's founder became the richest man in the world - for two days Chairman and chief executive Pablo Isla emphasised the firm's investment in technology, saying the firm had expanded its online stores to 11 new countries in the period. It also launched mobile phone payment in all its Spanish stores, with the objective of ""extending the service to other countries"". This will encompass online apps for all of its brands and a specific app for the whole group called InWallet. Mr Isla said: ""Both our online and bricks-and-mortar stores are seamlessly connected, driven by platforms such as mobile payment, and other technological initiatives that we will continue to develop."" Tom Gadsby, an analyst at Liberum, said the firm's ""online drive"" was important. ""I expect over the years they may find they don't have to open as many stores to maintain their strong growth rate as the online channel will become increasingly important,"" he said. ""And while Zara is available in many of the territories in which they operate [online], most of their other brands aren't readily available outside Europe online. ""So there is a big opportunity there for them to expand online into new territories."" The company also said it had benefited from steady economic growth in Spain, where Inditex gets about a fifth of its sales. That country's clothing market grew at an average of 3% in the three-months to the end of July, according to the Spanish statistics agency. All of the group's brands increased their international presence during the period, with 83 new stores opened in 38 countries. In a call with analysts, it said it would open 6-8% of new store space over course of the year. The firm's strong performance sets it apart from European rivals H&M and Next, which have blamed unseasonal weather for below-forecast results this year.","The group's clothes can now be bought online in around 40 countries, it said.

Sale have moved home games back to Friday nights for the upcoming season. ""I think there is some rebuilding to do because I think people in the early days of moving have had a pretty poor experience,"" Cotton told BBC Sport. ""That could be queuing up on a motorway, couldn't get away from the stadium, couldn't buy a drink at the ground.

He has promised to be active in his role, despite his commitments with his clothing business. ""What I really want to see is a very strong north of England club that can compete at the highest level,"" he added. ""That is my motivation for giving up the precious thing that I have got, and that is my time. ""I think what was lacking before was that the board weren't very often represented at games home and away, and I think that is very wrong - board members will travel to away games and home games."" One of the standout announcements from Sale's new 10-man board was that director of rugby Steve Diamond will have a seat on it. However, Cotton insists there will be no conflict of interest with a member of the coaching staff also working as a director.

4,38128851,"The film about a princess's mythical journey in ancient Polynesia took an estimated $81.1m (£65.3m) on its debut. That makes it the second-highest Thanksgiving debut of all time, behind Disney's Frozen, which took $93.6m (£75.3m) on its release in 2013. Some observers have said that Moana and its merchandise are appropriating Pacific Island culture. Disney withdrew a children's costume promoting the film after activists branded it ""brownface"", or mocking of their culture by stereotyping. The costume, a full-body suit with brown skin, traditional tattoos, grass skirt and bone necklace, represented the character Maui, considered a demi-god and ancestor by many Polynesians. Disney said it regretted any offence. JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them fell to second on the US chart, taking $65.8m (£53m). Gossip surrounding Brad Pitt's marriage break-up failed to spark a huge amount of interest in his World War Two romance Allied, which also stars Marion Cotillard. It took $18m (£14.4m) over the long weekend, having cost $85m (£68.5m) to make, landing in fourth spot behind Doctor Strange. Kyle Davies, Paramount's head of domestic distribution, said the film appealed to ""older audiences"" but noted those ""don't storm the theatres [on] weekend one"". ""I think they're going to take their time,"" he added. Warren Beatty fared worse - his first film in 15 years, the 1950s Hollywood comedy Rules Don't Apply, took just $2.2m (£1.7m).

5,36369346,"The University and College Union says the 1.1% rise offered by the universities is ""an insult"". But the Universities and Colleges Employers Association said the walkout was ""disappointing given the very good pay offer"". Unions representing university support staff are balloting on the offer, with strike action possible in the autumn. UCU says its members have suffered a real-terms pay cut of 14.% since 2009 and complains the squeeze on staff salaries has come as university leaders enjoyed hefty increases.

The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP is backing calls from Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson for Theresa May to adopt a more flexible approach that achieves a consensus across parties. Mr Crabb told BBC Wales: ""The majority of business opinion in Wales and the UK supports Britain staying in the single market and staying in the customs union but still coming out of the European Union legally. ""And I think that argument needs to get looked at far more closely and if we can't achieve a satisfactory deal based on membership of the single market we need something that is pretty close to it if it's going to achieve the consensus that it needs to across the parties.""

""We've talked about frictionless trade, the Welsh Government have talked about unfettered access. These are one and the same things,"" he said.

7,40668749,"Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of $80,000 (Â£62,000). The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for ""lone-wolf"" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: ""Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. ""The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect."" Guns account for less than 1% of items sold on the platform, with its main trade being in narcotics. Nevertheless, the volume being sold ""can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies"", said the report. The study involved collecting data from 12 dark net marketplaces during a week in September 2016. Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold. Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: ""In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal. ""The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities.""","Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets.

""I think if anyone is found to be doing it, that should be them. They shouldn't be playing again."" Fleming, 31, and his partner Jonathan Erlich, were beaten 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the first round of the Australian Open on Wednesday by Robin Haase and Fernando Verdasco.

That's key and they have to preserve that. ""I've never been approached to take money or anything to fix a match or lose a match. It does go on because people have been banned at lower levels. I'm surprised to see the article come out and talk about higher levels; I certainly haven't been aware of anything going on there."" The Scot said he had no idea as to the identity of the suspected match-fixers, and suggested additional funding could be granted to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU), set-up to police the sport. ""Your guess is as good as mine,"" he said of those involved. ""There were no names in the article because it's very difficult to prove anything. I think that's the issue the TIU has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty. ""It can just be people throwing money on a match.""

15,35564269,"His solicitor Julia Cooper has asked Surrey Police to explain a statement that he had confessed to the murder. Bellfield, 47, was given a whole-life prison sentence in June 2011 for murdering the schoolgirl. Surrey Police confirmed it had received a letter from Bellfield's solicitors but said it was standing by its statement on the confession. Milly was kidnapped while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Ms Cooper said Bellfield, now known as Yusuf Rahim, believed a ""covert tape"" may have been used to record his response to a police interview in prison. She said ""my client denies giving a confession"". She has written to Surrey Police requesting the tape recording and notes from the meeting. Ms Cooper said Bellfield contacted her very soon after Surrey Police distributed its press statement relating to the Dowler case. She said Bellfield denies all the crimes for which he has been convicted. Last month, Surrey Police revealed Bellfield had made the admission during an investigation into whether he had an accomplice involved in the abduction and rape, but not murder, of Milly. The force said it stood by its original statement. A police source speaking to the BBC would not comment on how the admission was recorded. Milly's body was found 25 miles away from where she was kidnapped, in Yateley Heath, Hampshire. Experts could not say how she died. Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and murdering the teenager following a trial at the Old Bailey where a judge described him as a ""cruel and pitiless killer"". He was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and Marsha McDonnell, 19, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, when he went on trial accused of killing Milly. He lived 50 yards from where Milly vanished but did not become a suspect until he was arrested by police in London for the other crimes in 2004. On Wednesday, the Dowler family revealed harrowing details of Milly's final hours, saying they had been made aware of her suffering last year after Bellfield had spoken to police.","Bellfield, 47, was given a whole-life prison sentence in June 2011 for murdering the schoolgirl.

17,19367277,"US experts found B3, also known as nicotinamide, boosts the ability of immune cells to kill Staphylococcus bacteria. B3 increases the numbers and efficacy of neutrophils, white blood cells that can kill and eat harmful bugs. The study, in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, could lead to a ""major change in treatment"", a UK expert said. B3 was tested on Staphylococcal infections, such as the potentially fatal MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Such infections are found in hospitals and nursing homes, but are also on the rise in prisons, the military and among athletes. The scientists used extremely high doses of B3 - far higher than that obtained from dietary sources - in their tests, carried out both on animals and on human blood. And the researchers say there is as yet no evidence that dietary B3 or supplements could prevent or treat bacterial infections. The researchers say B3 appears to be able to ""turn on"" certain antimicrobial genes, boosting the immune cells' killing power. Prof Adrian Gombart, of Oregon State University's Linus Pauling Institute, who worked on the research, said: ""This is potentially very significant, although we still need to do human studies. ""Antibiotics are wonder drugs, but they face increasing problems with resistance by various types of bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus. ""This could give us a new way to treat Staph infections that can be deadly, and might be used in combination with current antibiotics. ""It's a way to tap into the power of the innate immune system and stimulate it to provide a more powerful and natural immune response."" Prof Mark Enright, of the University of Bath, said: ""Neutrophils are really the front line against infections in the blood and the use of nicotinamide seems safe at this dose to use in patients as it is already licensed for use. ""This could cause a major change in treatment for infections alongside conventional antibiotics to help bolster patients immune system. ""I would like to see in patient clinical trials but cannot see why this couldn't be used straight away in infected patients.""","US experts found B3, also known as nicotinamide, boosts the ability of immune cells to kill Staphylococcus bacteria.

Up to 10,000 prison officers in England and Wales protested last month over claims of a ""surge"" in jail violence. They stopped work over claims of a ""surge in violence"" in jails but returned to work after a High Court injunction ordered them to end their 24-hour protest. Under the agreement, prison officers will be allowed to retire at 65 - up to three years ahead of the current state pension age - at no cost to them and with full pension benefits. Uniformed staff will also be given consolidated pay rises of between 0.5% and 1% for each of the next three years, on top of usual performance-related pay increases. They also stand to receive a ""recognition and retention"" package totalling Â£1,000. Prisons minister Sam Gyimah, said the government and POA had also ""agreed a significant number of health and safety reforms as well as new powers for governors in terms of how they deploy their staff in prisons"". The POA directed members to take action last month after talks with the government over health and safety concerns broke down. It came after multiple high-profile incidents at prisons across England. In October, Jamal Mahmoud, an inmate at HMP Pentonville, died after being stabbed to death in an attack at the prison, which left two others injured. And last month prisoners caused almost Â£1m of damage during a riot at Bedford prison. Days later at HMP Isle of Wight, an inmate cut a prison officer's throat with a razor blade on the way back to his cell.

26,37228741,"The country has now seen two consecutive quarters of declining growth, the usual definition of recession. Its vital oil industry has been hit by weaker global prices, according to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS). But the government says there has been strong growth in other sectors. Crude oil sales account for 70% of government income. The price of oil has fallen from highs of about $112 a barrel in 2014 to below $50 at the moment. Outside the oil industry, the figures show the fall in the Nigerian currency, the naira, has hurt the economy. It was allowed to float freely in June to help kick-start the economy, but critics argued it should have been done earlier. The government, however, has found some positive news in the figures. ""There was growth in the agricultural and solid minerals sectors... the areas in which the federal government has placed particular priority,"" said presidential economic adviser Adeyemi Dipeolu. Nigeria, which vies with South Africa for the mantle of Africa's biggest economy, is also battling an inflation rate at an 11-year high of 17.1% in July. ""A lot of Nigeria's current predicament could have been avoided,"" said Kevin Daly from Aberdeen Asset Management. ""The country is so reliant on oil precisely because its leaders haven't diversified the economy. ""More recently, they have tried, and failed, to prop up the naira, which has had a ruinous effect on the country's foreign exchange reserves and any reputation it might have had of being fiscally responsible."" This economic recession comes as no surprise to millions of Nigerians. Many say they've never known it so tough. The slump in global oil prices has hit Nigeria hard. The government depends on oil sales for about 70% of its revenues. But critics say government policies made a bad situation even worse. The decision to delay devaluing Nigeria's currency meant many businesses struggled to get foreign currency to pay for imports, which had a cooling effect on the entire economy. Following enormous pressure, the government changed tack this summer, allowing the naira to float. That's led to a spike in inflation, but the hope is that it will attract foreign investors. The government also says the country needs to import less: it wants to see more products made in Nigeria.","Its vital oil industry has been hit by weaker global prices, according to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

The full range is available to US users initially, with European customers having access to a small selection. Lionsgate said availability would increase during a global rollout. Steam, which is owned by game developer Valve, is the most popular digital games retailer, with more than 125 million users. The platform sells games through direct download, with extra gaming features like a friends' list and voice communication, built into the client. It's not the first time Steam has released video through its store. Game trailers and advertisements have been available for years, and it previously released gaming-related documentaries Free to Play and Indie Game: The Movie. It also struck a deal to sell the Mad Max film franchise to coincide with the release of the video game of the same name last year. The deal with Lionsgate, however, is the first large-scale agreement with a major production company. A spokesperson for Valve said Lionsgate's blockbuster franchises represent the type of entertainment it hopes will drive the continued expansion of their content catalogue. On launch, the worldwide selection is limited to 11 older titles, priced between Â£3.49 - Â£5.59 for a 48-hour rental - in line with other online rental prices for new releases. Unlike some of its competitors, however, Steam operates on almost any computer platform - including Linux and Mac - but does not yet offer its streaming service to mobile apps.

But some young people ""will find it a problem"" Sir Michael Wilshaw, told the Times Educational Supplement (TES). Sir Michael said vocational subjects would suit some pupils better. In particular he questioned whether the academic subjects included in the government's Ebacc would be the best thing for pupils who wanted to take apprenticeships when they left school. ""I can think of youngsters, even at the highest-performing schools, who will find it a problem and who would have been better suited to do English, maths and science and a range of vocational subjects,"" he told the magazine. In June, the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan confirmed she wants all pupils to have to study the five traditional subjects included in the Ebacc school performance measure. According to Mrs Morgan the move would ensure all pupils received a rigorous academic education and avoid pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds being put off academic subjects. In addition, the Conservative manifesto pledges that schools which do not have 100% of pupils studying this set of subjects at GCSE should not be able to obtain Ofsted's top rating of ""outstanding"". Both policies will be subject to a government consultation later in the autumn. Sir Michael told the TES he agreed more young people should be studying these subjects - but said the combination was not suitable for everyone. The Association of School and College Leaders, which represents secondary heads, welcomed Sir Michael's challenge to government policy. General Secretary Brian Lightman said the union shared his concerns. He said a recent survey by the union found almost 90% of school leaders disagreed with making these subjects compulsory for all pupils. ""It is unfair on young people to take a one-size-fits-all approach to their education. ""We are concerned that creative, technology and vocational subjects will be squeezed out of the curriculum."" Mr Lightman said the union would urge ministers to make the choice of GCSE subjects more flexible.

31,27660683,"The raids came a day after it emerged a Frenchman was being held by police investigating the murder of three people at the Brussels Jewish Museum. Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, was arrested at a station in Marseille on Friday. Prosecutors say he has claimed responsibility for the attack and spent more than a year in Syria. Interior Minister Bernard Cazaneuve told Europe 1 radio on Monday: ""There are people who recruit jihadists. There are as I'm speaking arrests being made."" ""We are acting everywhere. There will be no respite in the fight against terrorists."" There is no suggestion of a link between the four arrests on Monday and the detention of Mr Nemmouche during a random check on a coach arriving from Amsterdam in southern France on Friday. But Mr Nemmouche is said to have had links with radical Islamists and served five years in jail in France for robbery before being released in December 2012. When he was arrested, he had with him a Kalashnikov rifle and a handgun believed to have been used in the attack, the Paris prosecutor said. He was also said to have had a white sheet emblazoned with the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, a jihadist group fighting in Syria, and a camera with a 40-second video showing the two guns and a voice recording, claiming responsibility for the killings. Speaking on French radio station RTL on Monday, the head of French Jewish association CRIF, Roger Cukierman, called for more resources to be given to the foreign intelligence service, the DGSE, to track militants returning to France from Syria. He feared ""they would become 700 time bombs when they return"", referring to the estimated number of French-born jihadists in Syria. Belgium has requested Mr Nemmouche's extradition from France and police have to decide whether to extend his detention until Thursday. Three people died when a gunman opened fire at the museum in the busy Sablon area of the Belgian capital on 24 May. They were an Israeli couple in their 50s, and a French female volunteer.

32,34265094,"It follows 55,000 job cuts announced earlier this year. The losses will come in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which is splitting from the printer and PC business. The company says the cuts will save $2.7bn (Â£1.76bn) in annual costs, although the plan will cost $2.7bn to carry out. At a meeting for Wall Street analysts, chairman and chief executive Meg Whitman said: ""We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring."" The new structure proposed by Ms Whitman sees HP Enterprise focusing primarily on businesses and government agencies, and the PC and printing divisions on the consumer market. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees. ""The number is sadly larger than some people might have expected, but I think it's a reflection of how much trouble HP has been having with its services,"" said Charles King, analyst at the Silicon Valley IT consulting firm Pund-IT. ""I'm frankly not sure if HP is finished with the layoffs."" The company will not say where the cuts will fall, but part of the plan involves changing the nature of the workforce. The proportion of workers in what HPE calls ""low-cost locations"" is expected to rise from around 42% now to 60% by 2018. The tech company has struggled over the last decade to keep up with changing demands as customers move away from desktop computers. However, Hewlett-Packard is still one of the world's largest technology companies, with revenues this year expected to top $50bn. The company famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and grew to be the guiding light of what became known as Silicon Valley. Its fortunes started to decline with a series of expensive and much criticised acquisitions including Compaq for $25bn in 2002, consultants EDS for $14bn in 2008 and Autonomy for $11bn in 2011. In 2012 it lost its position as the world's leading supplier of PCs to Lenovo. The share price peaked at the height of the dot.com boom in 2000, and, despite two surges in 2007 and 2010, it has lost some 60% of its value since then.","It follows 55,000 job cuts announced earlier this year.

33,32919712,"Ministers are to publish draft laws they say are a ""landmark"" in prohibiting the substances' production, distribution, sale and supply. Legal highs, officially called new psychoactive substances, have been linked to a number of deaths. Ministers said young people who took them were ""taking exceptional risks with their health"". A blanket ban on legal highs, which are often sold online or on the high street, was in the Conservative Party's election manifesto and featured in the Queen's Speech. Labour also promised to ban their sale and distribution in its manifesto. The Psychoactive Substances Bill applied to ""any substance intended for human consumption that is capable of producing a psychoactive effect"", the government said. Alcohol, tobacco and caffeine will be excluded, and there are also exemptions for food and medical products, while controlled drugs will continue to be regulated by existing laws. The new restrictions will also extend to the sale of nitrous oxide - also known as laughing gas or ""hippy crack"" - for human use. What are legal highs? The government said the ""legitimate sale"" of nitrous oxide, which is also used for food processing, medicinal and industrial purposes, would not be affected. Home Office minister Mike Penning said the measures would ""fundamentally change the way we tackle new psychoactive substances"". They would end the ""game of cat and mouse"" whereby new drugs appeared on the market more quickly than the government could identify and ban them, he said. He added: ""The blanket ban will give police and other law enforcement agencies greater powers to tackle the reckless trade in psychoactive substances, instead of having to take a substance-by-substance approach."" Legal highs are not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act, although individual substances, such as mephedrone, have been outlawed. The government's proposals would apply throughout the United Kingdom, and would include powers to seize and destroy legal highs and to search people, premises and vehicles. Civil measures - including prohibition notices and prohibition orders - will also be possible.

34,28538337,"Judge Michael Levanas said the $2bn sale could go ahead. Mr Sterling, 80, had been contesting his estranged wife Shelly's decision to sell the basketball team franchise to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Mr Sterling was banned from basketball for life after he was recorded making racist remarks in April. The Los Angeles court case focused on allegations that Mrs Sterling used medical tests of her husband's mental capacity to remove him as a member of the trust that owned the team, and deceived him into selling. Mr Sterling had originally agreed to the sale of the basketball team, but then revoked his blessing, saying he had been improperly removed from the trust. Mrs Sterling had told her husband to seek an evaluation by two doctors in May. The doctors declared him ""mentally incapacitated"" and unfit to administer his duties as trustee of the Sterling Family Trust. This in effect handed Mrs Sterling control of the Clippers. Judge Levanas of the California Superior Court said he found Mrs Sterling to be a more credible witness than her husband and that she had acted properly over the sale, the BBC's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles reports. He said that Mrs Sterling ""had every good reason to believe that Donald agreed to the sale of the team"". Mrs Sterling burst into tears as the ruling was delivered after the nine-day hearing, saying: ""I can't believe it's over. I feel good."" The ruling would take effect in the coming weeks, the judge said. In a statement, the National Basketball Association (NBA) said it was ""pleased"" by the ruling. ""We look forward to the transaction closing as soon as possible,"" it said. The racism allegations had led the NBA to fine Mr Sterling $2.5m. It had also said it wanted to force Mr Sterling to sell the team. In a 10-minute audio recording published on celebrity website TMZ in April, Mr Sterling was heard telling a woman, subsequently identified as his girlfriend V Stiviano, not to associate in public with black people nor bring them to Clippers games. The remarks drew widespread condemnation from fans, retired basketball stars and President Barack Obama.

35,40260319,"Research suggest animals that build their nests in early spring may win the fight for available habitat at the expense of late breeders. Conservation efforts should focus on ensuring rare species have enough places to nest, say scientists. For example, areas could be left to grow wild between spring and summer to help bumblebees establish nests. Habitats such as hedgerows and hay meadows are being lost in many countries, meaning that fewer nesting sites are available. Competition among animals for a suitable place to nest could explain why some species are struggling to survive. ""Ecologists understand why some groups of species are declining more, such as why farmland species are declining more than woodland species,"" said Dr Andrew Higginson of the University of Exeter. ""But an enduring mystery is the big variation in the declines of closely related species. Fighting over nest sites may be part of the reason - when nest sites are hard to come by, the species that will suffer most are those that nest later in the year."" The University of Exeter study analysed population changes in more than 200 bird species and 40 bumblebee species around the world. The population data was combined with a mathematical model that used game theory to predict the likely behaviour of bees and birds when faced with competition for nesting sites. It calculated the implications of fighting for nesting sites, based on the size of each species, the time of nesting and the quality of the nesting site. The study found larger species that nest early generally do better, while smaller bees and birds that nest later in the year lose out in the struggle for habitat. For example, the chaffinch is doing well in the UK, while the goldfinch is on the decline. ""We need to have a more holistic approach to providing good habitat for animals,"" Dr Higginson told BBC News. ""We need to worry about the whole life cycle not just what they eat."" He said conservation efforts for animals such as birds and bees tend to focus on providing food. Restoration and provision of nest sites should be an urgent priority, he said. This could be as simple as waiting to cut hedgerows until later in the year when all animals have nested or providing more boxes for birds to nest in.

46,28226775,"It comes after a dispute over whether Wales had the power to set minimum wages, or if that right laid with the UK government. UK Attorney General Dominic Grieve originally blocked a law passed by AMs last year, saying it was not within the assembly's powers. UK ministers said they were grateful for clarity on the issue.

On Wednesday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said the ""significant"" Supreme Court judgment ""goes some way to clarifying the complexities of the current devolution settlement"".

He called for Wales to move to a form of devolution where powers are assumed to rest with the assembly in cases like this, unless legislation specifically rules this out. Welsh Secretary David Jones said UK ministers were ""grateful to the Supreme Court for providing clarity on this issue"" and they would ""study the judgment in detail and consider its implications"".

The anti-corruption agency has also called for her to be personally liable for losses to state coffers. Ms Yingluck was removed by a court in May 2014, shortly before the military ousted her elected government. She was later impeached over the rice subsidy scheme and banned from politics for five years. Thailand, meanwhile, remains under martial law in the wake of the coup. Ms Yingluck was not at Bangkok's Supreme Court to hear the indictment. But the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says today's court filing will seem to her supporters like yet another attempt by the military to crush her politically for whenever Thailand does return to democratic rule. Under the rice subsidy scheme Ms Yingluck's Pheu Thai-led government bought rice from Thai farmers at above the market rate, costing the government billions of dollars. Critics accused Ms Yingluck of funnelling money to her core supporters. She said the policy was aimed at helping farmers and denied any day-to-day involvement in the running of the scheme. The Supreme Court will decide on 19 March whether to pursue the criminal case. Additionally, Finance Minister Sommai Phasee said on Wednesday that the ministry had received a letter from the national corruption watchdog urging it to pursue civil suit against Ms Yingluck to recover losses of 600bn baht ($18.4bn; Â£11.9bn) related to the scheme. ""The finance ministry oversees damages to the state and is ready to take action,"" he said. The military seized power in May 2014 in what it said was a bid to restore public order after months of occasionally violent street protests against Ms Yingluck's government. But Thailand has been embroiled in a cycle of political instability since the military ousted Ms Yingluck's brother, billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, as prime minister in 2006. The Shinawatra family are hugely popular among Thailand's rural population but are hated by the urban middle-class and elite who accuse them of corruption.

Chan-hom is now heading north past the city of Shanghai. The typhoon hit Taiwan and Japan earlier in the week, uprooting trees and injuring several people. Chan-hom first hit Zhejiang province on an island near the city of Ningbo at around 16:40 (08:40 GMT), the National Meteorological Center said. No deaths or injuries were reported in the region by Saturday evening, state news agency Xinhua said. One village, Laiao, received more than 400mm (16in) of rain, it said. The BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai says more than 400 flights have been cancelled there along with a number of public events, and the government has told people they should stay at home. Dozens of flights were also cancelled in Zhoushan, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Wenzhou. Zhejiang province has called its entire fishing fleet back to port. Some 100 train services were also cancelled. Peter Abram, who is in Ningbo, told the BBC: ""The supermarkets got cleaned out yesterday morning. I just tried to take a walk, but got blown back inside. ""The only people out in the thick of it are emergency services... All us Westerners here in Ningbo seem to be safely battened down in our apartments, candles at the ready."" Philippa Osborne, who is in Shanghai, said: ""From where I live in the middle of Shanghai, people have certainly heeded the warning to stay home. There are virtually no pedestrians out on the street, and the road traffic volume has been greatly reduced."" Chinese television showed footage of coastal regions being battered by torrential rain as the typhoon neared. Images from the region also showed flooded farmland. Our correspondent says China is well used to dealing with such storms, although this is possibly the strongest July typhoon to hit Zhejiang since 1949. The highest red-alert warning remains in force, despite the storm being downgraded in category from super to strong.","Chan-hom is now heading north past the city of Shanghai.

It will sit in a slightly higher price segment than the main H&M brand. The move comes as competition online and on the High Street is squeezing profits at the fashion giant. After London, more Arket stores will follow in Brussels, Copenhagen and Munich, and the new brand will be launched online.

The strikes came after the Taliban stormed Karachi airport, in an attack that killed at least 30 people. The Pakistani Taliban said Sunday's assault was in revenge for the killing of their leader last year. ""Nine terrorist hideouts were destroyed by early morning military air strikes near the Pakistan-Afghan border,"" the military said in a statement on Tuesday. The Khyber tribal region, near the Pakistan-Afghan border, is believed to be a base for several militant groups and foreign fighters. It is not clear when the air strikes took place or which militant group was targeted, the BBC's Shahzeb Jillani in Islamabad reports. Late on Sunday, 10 heavily armed Taliban fighters attacked an area of Karachi's Jinnah international airport used mainly for cargo and private flights. Security forces gained control in the early hours of Monday. The airport reopened late on Monday. Officials said at least 29 people were killed in the fighting which raged from Sunday into Monday, including all the militants. On Tuesday, officials said nine more bodies had been recovered from the airport. The number included seven bodies found in the airport's cold storage facility. Officials said they were charred beyond recognition. There were reports that the bodies belonged to a group of airport employees who were trapped in the facility after taking refuge from the attack. Pakistan has been fighting an Islamist insurgency for more than a decade, with the Pakistani Taliban the main militant grouping. The airport attack came against the backdrop of a major split in the Pakistani Taliban, and threats of retaliation following limited military operations against foreign militants in North Waziristan. The brazen attack has brought the government of the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, under renewed pressure to order tough action against the Taliban militants, says the BBC's Shahzeb Jillani. The Pakistan government began peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban in March, but little progress has been made and the violence has continued, with Karachi a frequent target. Correspondents say that given the violence, it seems clear that any pretence at a peace process is now over.","""Nine terrorist hideouts were destroyed by early morning military air strikes near the Pakistan-Afghan border,"" the military said in a statement on Tuesday.

Spanish captain Patricia Guijarro doubled the lead with a tremendous dipping shot in the 52nd minute. While Spain bossed the game, Abbie Magee went close for the hosts. Substitute Magee tested Spanish keeper Noelia Ramos in the 74th minute after a brilliant run out of defence by Megan Bell. The hosts are making their first appearance in the finals while Spain have been runners-up in three of the last four Uefa Under-19 women's tournaments.

56,39922085,"Police say the Arena clan made money by providing services at Isola di Capo Rizzuto in Italy's far south and siphoning off state funds. The clan is alleged to have hidden behind a local Catholic charity which officially runs the centre. The claims came to light on Monday, when officers arrested 68 people, including a local priest. Another of those arrested was Leonardo Sacco, head of the Catholic Misericordia association that is supposed to control the Sant'Anna Cara immigrant centre. The centre holds 1,500 people at a time. It is alleged the Arena clan, part of the powerful 'Ndrangheta crime syndicate, may have taken more than a third of the €100m ($109m/£85m) destined for the centre in the past 10 years. The priest, named as Edoardo Scordio, had received €132,000 already this year for ""spiritual services"", an assistant prosecutor alleged. Police in Catanzaro, a city in the southern Calabria region, said more than 500 agents were involved in the arrests of suspects ""accused of mafia association, extortion, carrying illegal weapons, fraud, embezzlement to the detriment of the state, (and) theft"". The arrests come two years after L'Espresso magazine published an investigation, alleging funds were being stolen and managers were making money by starving the migrants who lived there. A year earlier, it was alleged the number of migrants said to be living at the centre had been greatly over exaggerated, while in 2013 a health inspection found asylum seekers were being fed small portions of out-of-date food. Police believe the clan, through Mr Sacco, was awarding contracts, including for food supplies, to other members of the 'Ndrangheta syndicate, as well as setting up its own associations. According to Rosy Bindi, the head of parliament's anti-mafia commission, the centre had effectively been transformed into ""a money printing operation for organised crime"". ""This operation shows the ability of the mafia to take advantage of the weaknesses and fragility of our times with its predatory and parasitic approach,"" she added.","Police say the Arena clan made money by providing services at Isola di Capo Rizzuto in Italy's far south and siphoning off state funds.

63,36445024,"An investigation by Northampton Borough Council discovered 21 homeless people in the town, including ""a significant proportion of European migrants"". The people were ""resolutely refusing to leave the streets"", the report said. Council officials held talks with 30 organisations to develop a plan to eliminate rough sleeping by June 2017. Lithuanian Kristians Olsteins has been rough sleeping in Northampton for about four months after losing his job and passport. He said it was not a lifestyle choice for him and he would like nothing more than to have a home. Mike Hallet, who has been homeless for two years, also denied it was a choice. He said: ""Of course, I would like to be off the streets - it is horrible and I would rather be anywhere else."" But Darren Jordan, who lived on the streets for two months before finding space in a homeless shelter, believes ""some people get stuck in a rut and then it does become a lifestyle choice"". Northampton Hope Centre runs a day centre supporting people who are homeless or in poverty and was one of the organisations consulted by council officials. General manager Robin Burgess said: ""It's clear there are people who have become accustomed to life on the street over many years - or even decades. ""Some are European and some are addicted to drink and alcohol - but I don't believe anyone actively chooses to sleep on the streets."" He said the way to address homelessness is to supply individual support for as long as is needed. Under a three-year plan set to be discussed on Wednesday, it is proposed that Northampton Borough Council will provide a temporary night shelter which would require some initial set-up costs ""likely to be under Â£50,000"". The financial implications of setting up and running the shelter for up to 18 months will be fully-costed and any plan will require approval. ""Comprehensive support plans"" for ""rough sleepers with complex needs"" would also be introduced. Crisis, a charity for single homeless people, said rough sleeping was ""incredibly dangerous"" and a homeless person was ""13 times more likely to be a victim of violence than the average member of the public"". Chief executive Jon Sparkes added: ""Rather than blaming the people in these desperate circumstances, we need to focus on acting quickly and decisively to get them the support they need.""","An investigation by Northampton Borough Council discovered 21 homeless people in the town, including ""a significant proportion of European migrants"".

Mr Lamb - who lost out to Tim Farron in a leadership election in July - proposes a cross-party commission to explore the ideas. He intends to consult health bodies and professionals, patients, trade unions and academics. Ministers have pledged £2bn in this financial year for the NHS, and an extra £8bn by 2020. But Mr Lamb told the BBC that this was insufficient and, having ""seen the books"" as a minister in the last government, he feared the NHS could face a funding shortfall of £30bn by 2020. ""The bottom line is with rising demand because of an ageing population we need more investment,"" he said.

In a screening prior to signing for the club, an electrocardiogram test showed his heart was ""unequivocally abnormal"" but he was not stopped from playing. The club regretted a former employee had been remiss in their duties. In a statement, the family of Mr Hamed, who is now 27, said they were ""relieved"" a settlement had been reached, following a decade-long legal battle . ""Just as Radwan had no choice but to start his difficult journey towards recovery, we had no choice but to start the difficult journey to obtain justice,"" they said. ""We risked losing our home and faced personal financial ruin in order to pursue justice for our son. ""The club did not tell us or Radwan about his potentially fatal condition. Had they done so, Radwan would not have continued to play football."" The teenager collapsed during the game against Cercle Bruges on 4 August 2006 and was rushed to an intensive care unit but suffered oxygen starvation to his brain. In the 2015 hearing, Mr Justice Hickinbottom ruled the club was 70% liable or Mr Hamed's injuries and Dr Peter Mills, the Football Association's regional cardiologist for South East England, was 30% liable. The Premier League club will not be hit with a fee directly as their 70% portion was incurred by physicians they previously employed, who have agreed to indemnify the club. Football Association rules require all football academy recruits to be referred to a cardiologist to help identify those prone to potentially fatal heart conditions. Mr Hamed's MRI scan showed no obvious signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but Dr Mills wrote to Spurs saying the condition could not be excluded on these findings alone.

Executive director of the Golf and Health project Dr Roger Hawkes said the aim had been to add some ""scientific rigour"" to statements made about golf and wellbeing. ""For a number of years we've felt we've underplayed the likely benefits of golf on peoples' health,"" he said.

""Given that the sport can be played by the very young to the very old, this demonstrates a wide variety of health benefits for people of all ages."" The study suggested playing golf could help players meet and exceed minimum government recommendations for moderate to vigorous physical activity. It claimed that golfers walking 18 holes could cover four to eight miles, while those using an electric golf cart typically chalked up four miles. Players burned a minimum of 500 calories over 18 holes, it said. World Golf Foundation CEO Steve Mona said the Golf and Health Project was vital to the development of the sport.

67,36206936,"The specialist, Dr Howard Kornfeld, was unable to make it from California to Minnesota immediately but sent his son. In a strange turn of events, it was his son, Andrew Kornfeld, who called police after joining Prince's staff to search for the missing singer. The Kornfelds' lawyer said neither had met Prince before his death. William Mauzy told reporters on Wednesday that Prince's team contacted Dr Howard Kornfeld on 20 April, the day before Prince died. Unable to make it to Minnesota, the doctor dispatched his son and called a local doctor, who cleared his morning schedule but never saw the singer. When Andrew Kornfeld, who works with his father but is not a doctor, arrived at Prince's Paisley Park home, he was told that the singer was missing. He joined members of staff to search the property and made the emergency call when Prince's unresponsive body was found. Mr Mauzy said the plan was to stabilise him in Minnesota, before flying him to California to seek treatment at Dr Kornfeld's Recovery Without Walls rehab centre in Mill Valley. The lawyer confirmed that Andrew Kornfeld had been interviewed by police, but was protected by Minnesota's Good Samaritan law. The law offers some legal protections to those who make emergency calls, to encourage them to do so. No details have been released from Prince's autopsy exam, but investigators are looking into whether he died from an overdose and if a doctor was prescribing him drugs in the weeks before his death. They are also trying to establish whether a doctor was on the singer's plane when it made an emergency landing less than a week before he died. The musician was found unconscious on the plane after it stopped in Moline, Illinois, on 15 April. Detectives investigating his death have asked to see fire and ambulance records related to the emergency landing. It emerged on Wednesday that emergency calls were made from the Paisley Park complex 46 times in the past five years. A log released by Minnesota authorities showed the 911 calls related to everything from medical emergencies to false fire alarms. It included one call in 2011 in which an unidentified woman said she was concerned about Prince's cocaine use, but no police action was taken.","In a strange turn of events, it was his son, Andrew Kornfeld, who called police after joining Prince's staff to search for the missing singer.

68,35706703,"In 2014, 27 motorcyclists were killed and the number of serious injuries also rose from 507 to 514 in the year up to September 2015. London Assembly's Transport Committee said the figure for deaths was ""unacceptably high"". TfL said more police have been deployed in accident hotspots and it is focusing on motorcycle and scooter safety. The figures were released as the London Assembly committee published its report â€˜Easy Rider: Improving motorcycle safety on London roadsâ€™. Researchers spoke to 1,200 riders and found one in five had been involved in a collision and about 62% motorcyclists had been involved in a near-miss incident. In 2010, 4,337 motorcyclists were injured in London, which by 2014 rose to 5,233, an increase of nearly 21%. The report found the inconsistency over access to bus lanes causes ""unnecessary confusion"" as TfL allows motorcyclists to ride in bus lanes on the roads it manages, while many boroughs do not. It also asked TfL to monitor the impact of dedicated Cycle Superhighways on the road space shared by other traffic. The report also called on authorities to educate young riders. Valerie Shawcross, chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee, said: ""Arguably motorcyclists have been overlooked in public discussion about road safety in recent years. ""However, 36 motorcyclists were killed on London's roads last year, a death toll that is unacceptably high, and part of a bigger picture of collisions and injuries affecting motorcyclists, many of them life-changing in their seriousness."" TfL said that since September police had stopped 5,389 riders, issued 742 traffic offence reports, 1,335 verbal warnings, seized 96 motorcycles and made 10 arrests. Police will also target the boroughs where motorcyclists are at greatest risk of injury.

He and co-accused Matthew Stansfield, 34, deny conspiracy to rape a child. They also deny conspiracy to sexually assault a child under the age of 13. Mr Stansfield, from Hampshire, has pleaded guilty to child pornography offences. The court heard that the alleged plan to rape a baby was to have taken place on 17 January last year in Bedfordshire. However, it did not happen because another man, Robin Hollyson, who had access to the intended victim, had been detained in hospital. Hollyson, 30, has already pleaded guilty to the rape of a child and conspiracy to rape a child during 2013 and 2014. Mr Denham, who has two children and was previously known as Benjamin Harrop, said in court he did not believe the intended victim existed. But he admitted that months afterwards he had watched a video showing Hollyson raping the child. The court has heard how members of a gang raped and abused young children, live streaming the attacks over the internet. The men contacted each other using Skype, video conferencing software and online chatrooms. Mr Denham said he had begun by viewing adult pornography online but after seeing an image of a young teenage girl performing a sex act on a man he became ""oddly fascinated"" by child pornography.

The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces.

The technology is being designed to automatically edit a whole game down to the key moments. The people behind it at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia have been working on it for a few years and have just published 18 pages of exactly how it works. Arnau Raventos is the lead professor on the project. He tells Newsbeat they have ""been working with the local television companies in Spain in order to try to make the job easier for the person who manually does the summaries currently."" Without having to read the full report (we did that for you) - in short - it analyses what are known as key-frames. So, every part of the match is looked over by the computer to spot tell-tale signs of when something interesting is happening. That might be lots of players grouped together, lots of zoomed-in action, extra noise from the crowd or the sound of the referee's whistle. Arnau calls them ""occasions"". ""We want to find specific combinations of moments in a football match. A goal is an occasion."" We thought of an example: if a defender goes down in the penalty box, everyone groups around them, you'll hear a whistle, there's lots of faces in the shot and a penalty happens. In theory, the technology should capture that. There is a long way to go though. The technology could frustrate even the most lukewarm of football fans because it hasn't quite nailed exactly the magic moment - when the goal goes in. In a test on five matches, the technology detected 70 per cent of the total goals. ""We need to be sincere,"" says Arnau. ""We need to say that at the moment it's not possible to perform a complete automatic summary just yet. It's difficult to detect all the goals.""

The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says police had suggested there was probably not too much to worry about, but the authorities still sent out officers with guns and tranquilisers. The hunt has focused on areas near the Disneyland Paris theme park. There was a fresh alert on Friday morning after paw prints were discovered near a service station east of Paris. To reach there, the animal had apparently crossed the A4 motorway. Police guarded the entrances to schools in the Montevrain area in case the cat turned up, as a helicopter with thermal imaging hovered. Local residents were asked to stay indoors and parents urged to take their children to and from school by car. A dozen or so soldiers from a nearby army base joined police and fire officials combing the countryside outside Montevrain. A huntsman, officially designated as a ""wolf catcher"", who has a specially trained dog, was also part of the search team.

75,33681460,"Fifa president Sepp Blatter announced plans last week to form an 11-person panel to review football's scandal-hit world governing body. Domenico Scala had earlier said he would only lead the taskforce if he is guaranteed full independence. The Swiss businessman is already the independent chair of Fifa's audit and compliance committee. Scala was believed to have been prepared to lead the taskforce, after meeting presidents of three of Fifa's six continental confederations. But a spokesman for Scala told BBC Sport: ""Domenico Scala never applied for such a chairmanship."" He added that the post would only be considered ""under the strict condition"" that ""independence was guaranteed"". As well as an independent chair, the taskforce will have two representatives from the AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), Concacaf (North, Central America and the Caribbean) and Uefa (Europe), as well as one representative from each of Conmebol (South America) and the OFC (Oceania). In a statement, Fifa said representatives from federations would not necessarily have to be ""members of the football community"" and the confederations could decide that themselves. Blatter, who has announced his intention to stand down as president, has said presidential term limits and integrity checks for top officials are potential areas of reform. Recommendations are due to be presented at the next meeting of Fifa's executive committee in Zurich on 24 and 25 September. The prospect of Scala leading an independent review of Fifa was described as ""laughable"" by campaign group New Fifa Now. And Alexandra Wrage, who resigned from Fifa's independent governance committee in April 2013 in protest at a lack of meaningful action, said even an independent chairman of the reform taskforce ""can't work"".

That prompted calls from Scottish and Welsh airports for similar treatment. The UK Treasury said it had not ruled out devolving APD to Scotland and Wales in the future.

Earlier this year Chancellor George Osborne announced the duty would be cut for direct long-haul routes from Northern Ireland airports, and he would devolve control over the tax to the Northern Irish Assembly.

Home Retail recently sold its DIY chain Homebase to Australia's Wesfarmers last month for £340m, leaving Argos as its only remaining business. Total sales at Argos rose 1.9% to £515m in the eight-week period as demand for furniture and sports goods offset lower sales of electrical goods, such as video games and tablet computers. The company said Argos opened 90 new stores over the year, bringing the total to 845. The new openings held back the like-for-like sales total over the period, it added. Chief executive John Walden, who said it had been ""another rather eventful period"" for the company, was pleased with the improvement in Argos' sales. Shares in Home Retail closed down almost 0.5% at 179.1p, but have risen more than 80% this year following Sainsbury's interest in Argos.

The Visa figures show overall spending was 08% lower than in 2016, the first fall since September 2013. The findings chime with official data from the Office for National Statistics, which shows that wage growth is falling back while inflation is rising, causing a squeeze on household incomes as they fail to keep pace with shop prices. The latest official figures showed wage growth behind inflation for the first time since mid-2014, and the Bank of England has said it expects this to get worse. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.1% in the three months to March, while inflation rose by 2.3% in the year to March 2017.

As the consumer we have been the driver of the UK economic engine - and now you can hear it start to splutter,"" adds Mr Urquart-Stewart, co-founder of fund manager Seven Investment Management. One of the chief reasons for inflation's rise is the steep fall in sterling since the UK voted to leave the European Union. It is now worth between 11-15% less against the euro and the dollar, making anything we buy with our weaker currency more expensive. That leaves shops with a dilemma, shred their often already paper-thin profit margins or raise prices.","Its latest survey shows household spending dipped for the first time in four years last month with families ""starting to feel the squeeze"" as higher living costs eat into pay.

That leaves shops with a dilemma, shred their often already paper-thin profit margins or raise prices.","We're buying fewer clothes and pairs of shoes, although we're eating out more, according to credit card firm Visa.",497,244

85,34418595,"Mourinho has been cleared of making discriminatory comments to Carneiro, who has since left the club. But Dyke, in a letter to FA Council members, said the 52-year-old Portuguese ""made a mistake"". The FA has been criticised by one of its board members - Heather Rabbatts - for its handling of the case. Rabbatts, head of the FA's inclusion advisory board, said the governing body's reaction had been ""seriously disappointing"". ""I have major concerns over the way in which the disciplinary process has been conducted,"" she added. The FA investigated after a member of public made a complaint about Mourinho's language towards Carneiro during Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Swansea on 8 August. Carneiro and head physio Jon Fearn had treated Eden Hazard for an injury after being called onto the pitch by the referee, which meant the player had to leave the field. That meant Chelsea were reduced to nine men, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois having been sent off, and Mourinho criticised the pair in a post-match news conference. Carneiro, 42, had her role downgraded before deciding to leave the club. ""I don't think Mr Mourinho comes well out of the whole saga - he clearly made a mistake in the heat of a game, and should have said so and apologised,"" said FA chairman Dyke. ""Instead he has said very little and Miss Carneiro has lost her job. ""Our regulatory team have investigated this and whilst Mr Mourinho has breached no rules, it was clearly a failure of his personal judgement and public behaviour."" The Women in Football campaign group said its language expert is certain Mourinho used abusive language, contrary to the verdict of the FA's chosen expert. But the FA said it had appointed an independent academic expert in Portuguese linguistics to study the footage of the incident, which included the audio recording. ""We have engaged an expert of high calibre to address such an important issue such as discriminatory language, which we take very seriously,"" said a spokesperson. Rabbatts said the FA had failed to act previously over sexist and abusive chanting towards Carneiro by fans in stadiums.","The FA investigated after a member of public made a complaint about Mourinho's language towards Carneiro during Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Swansea on 8 August.

86,37215189,"Mylan said it expected to start selling a cheaper generic product ""in several weeks"" at a list price of $300 (Â£230). That is about half the list price of the existing product, which is used in emergencies for severe food and insect allergies. The cost of EpiPens in the US has risen by 500% in less than a decade. Mylan said the generic version would be identical to the branded EpiPen, which costs $600 for two doses. Allergy sufferers often have several pens - one to keep at home, as well as others at school or work, or in the car. They also expire after 12 months. Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch said the company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving the product since buying the product from Merck in 2007. ""Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response,"" she said. ""We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option."" The move is unusual because the branded version is still under patent and other rival treatments have failed to get regulatory clearance. The product generates annual sales of $1bn for Mylan. Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said: ""We suspect Mylan will continue to receive some heat for its price increases and there will be heightened pressure on FDA [regulator the Food and Drug Administration] to bring competition to the market."" Ms Bresch also blamed the complex US health care system for the price rises and said that Mylan took just $274 of the $600 list price, while insurers, pharmacies and other parties shared the rest. How much individuals pay for an EpiPen prescription can depend on their insurance coverage. Politicians and parents have challenged the price hikes, with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton calling them ""outrageous"" and unjustified. The outcry over EpiPen price rises sent Mylan shares falling about 12% last week. The stock was flat at $43.04 in afternoon trading in New York. Actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who had endorsed EpiPens, said last week she was ending her relationship with Mylan. She had previously spoken about the importance of the treatment to her family because of her son's peanut allergy.

90,12325285,"Moderate exercise increased the size of the hippocampus, an area of the brain that makes memories, in 120 volunteers. The year-long trial, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed performance on memory tests also improved. Exercise may buffer against dementia as well as age-related memory loss. The latest work looked at healthy people in their 60s rather than people with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. But the findings have important implications for ageing societies faced with a dementia time bomb. In the UK, 820,000 people have dementia, and this figure is set to double by 2030. Until a cure is discovered, finding cheap and simple ways to reverse this trend is imperative, say experts. Professor Kirk Erickson and colleagues from the University of Pittsburgh in the US set out to investigate the impact that even moderate exercise might have on preserving memory. They split their 120 volunteers into two groups. One group was asked to begin an exercise regimen of walking around a track for 40 minutes a day, three days a week, while the others were limited to doing simple stretching and toning exercises. Brain scans and memory tests were performed at the start of the study, halfway through the study and again at the end. Scans revealed hippocampus volume increased by around 2% in people who did regular aerobic exercise. The same region of the brain decreased in volume by 1.4% in those who did stretching exercises, consistent with the decrease seen in normal ageing. Both groups showed some improvement over time on memory tests. In the walking group, the improvement appeared to be linked with increased size of the hippocampus. Professor Erickson said: ""We think of the atrophy of the hippocampus in later life as almost inevitable. But we've shown that even moderate exercise for one year can increase the size of that structure. ""The brain at that stage remains modifiable."" Dr Simon Ridley of the Alzheimer's Research Trust said that although the study does not look at memory loss in Alzheimer's or dementia, it suggests ""it's never too late to start exercising to help keep our brains healthy"". ""Even modest exercise may improve memory and help protect the brain from normal decline caused by ageing.

92,40713519,"The Independent Police Complaints Commission said there were six fatal police shootings between April 2016 to March 2017, up from three in 2015/16. The number of deaths in police road traffic incidents rose by 11 to 32 - the biggest total in eight years. The six shootings included that of Westminster attacker Khalid Masood. It is the highest number in 12 years. Twenty-eight of the road traffic deaths were related to police pursuits of vehicles. Since the IPCC was set up in 2004, there have never been more than a handful of fatal police shootings in a year, so the fact there have been six is unlikely to raise alarm bells. And, as the watchdog points out, the number has to be set in context: there were more than 14,700 police firearms operations during the same 12-month period - the vast majority pass off without a shot being fired, let alone anyone dying. However, the sharp rise in pursuit-related deaths - after a concerted effort by police and the IPCC to reduce the number of such casualties - will prompt searching questions. Of the 28 who died, 18 were either passengers in the suspect vehicle or other road users. Does the rise simply reflect an upsurge in criminal activity? Is it because suspects have become increasingly reckless? Or have police standards on the roads slipped? The IPCC and the National Police Chiefs' Council will have to get to the bottom of it quickly. Dame Anne Owers, chairwoman of the IPCC, said the six fatal shootings occurred across six forces. The shooting of Khalid Masood was the only one related to terrorism. The watchdog said the investigation into that case and two others had been completed and all three found no evidence of any misconduct by firearms officers. In addition, another inquiry, which is still ongoing, is also yet to find any evidence of wrongdoing by police. Investigations into two other shootings are still to conclude. The National Police Chiefs Council and the IPCC will examine whether changes to police pursuit safety or training are needed after the rise in road traffic deaths, added Dame Anne.

93,22071055,"She died peacefully, aged 87, on Monday the 8th of April 2013. She was given a ceremonial funeral with full military honours on 17 April. From the start of her time as prime minister Margaret Thatcher divided opinion. When she came to power in 1979 she wanted to make big changes to how the country was run - and she transformed Britain. One of her biggest changes was that she wanted private companies and people, and not officials, to run government-owned things like British Gas and BT (British Telecom). She believed that private companies would run the services better. Thousands of ordinary people were able to buy their council houses, giving them more of a stake in society. Under her rule, the City of London became one of the world's most successful centres for banking and business. The PM became a hero to many when in 1982 she sent British Troops to defend the Falklands. The tiny islands eight thousand miles away in the South Atlantic sea had been invaded by Argentina. Although hundreds of lives were lost, the victory was celebrated on the streets back home.

In 1984 thousands of miners protested for a whole year against her plans to shut down lots of coal mines and cut lots of jobs. And in 1990, there was fighting on the streets of London because of a new tax - called the poll tax - that people thought hit poor people harder than the rich. Margaret Thatcher was thought to have survived on just four hours sleep a night - and got the nickname ""the Iron Lady"" for being tough and sticking to her decisions.

After 11 years in power - and winning three elections - she'd been prime minister for longer than anyone else in the 20th century. Margaret Thatcher's life in pictures But eventually even her own party thought she had been in charge too long - and she left Downing Street in tears.

She was given a ceremonial funeral with full military honours on 17 April. From the start of her time as prime minister Margaret Thatcher divided opinion. She believed that private companies would run the services better. Under her rule, the City of London became one of the world's most successful centres for banking and business.

However, the distiller reported that Jameson's, the biggest-selling Irish whiskey, continued to be the star performer among its premium brands. American sales of the Cork-distilled whiskey were up more than 10%. In its update for investors, the drinks company reported total sales rose 3% in the first three months of 2017, and the detail gave some pointers to the market for whisky and other drinks around the world. Pernod Ricard reported the Chinese market ""remains challenging for Scotch"", while there were more positive sales figures for Martell brandy. Imported spirits have been held back in China by official disapproval of conspicuous business hospitality and gifts. Bar and restaurant sales were reported to remain in decline. The company said Korean sales continue a ""strong decline"" across its brands. It also reported on the disruptive effect in India of the government removing large amounts of the nation's paper money from circulation, and a new law that will forbid the sale of alcohol close to highways. In Latin America, which has been a strong growth area for Scotch exports, Brazilian sales were weaker due to prolonged recession. But sales across the Pernod Ricard brands were strongly up in other countries, led by Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay and Cuba. The UK market was described as resilient and ""dynamic"", because its products were being imported ahead of price increases in March, linked to the weakening of sterling. Among the stronger performers were Absolut vodka and Jameson's. With its full year results for 2015-16, Pernod Ricard reported Jameson's global sales were up 12% by volume and 16% by value. In Scotch whisky, Ballentine's rose 5% by volume over the year, while Chivas was down 5% and Glenlivet single malt by 2%. Another French company with a stake in Scotch whisky, Remy-Martin, this week reported that its sales of ""Progressive Hebridean"" spirits, including Bruichladdich and The Botanist gin, rose by more than 10% in the year to March.","American sales of the Cork-distilled whiskey were up more than 10%.

Yorkshire went into the game with a 34-point lead over Warwickshire, but soon found themselves in dire straits on 54-5. Gary Ballance's hopes of finding form after being omitted from England's Test squad came to nothing as he made six from 27 balls before being caught at slip off Onions. Glenn Maxwell's 36 was the only score of any note before Bresnan and Sidebottom came together at 95-9. Bresnan was eventually bowled by Paul Harrison, but then struck the first blow in Durham's reply when Graham Clark gave a catch to point. With Paul Collingwood absent because of a back problem, acting skipper Mark Stoneman was caught hooking at long leg and 18-year-old debutant Jack Burnham was bowled by Liam Plunkett for a four-ball duck. Durham's decline continued, with Sidebottom taking three of the last four wickets, including Ryan Pringle for 40, as their innings lasted just two balls longer than Yorkshire's. Umpires Nick Cook and Jeremy Lloyds confirmed after the match that they were happy with the way the pitch had played and would not call in a pitch liaison officer.

Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus. ""It feels like the start of something big,"" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me. It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising. For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters ""for the sake of their future"". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability. But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC. Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president. Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC. This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder. The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year. However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption. Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned.

Bluntly, the divorce bill would have to settled before talks on trade can begin. What's more, only one party to the break-up, the European Council, would decide if the settlement is good enough.

Because now her own party's apparent unity is set to be tested. If some of her own MPs don't like the size of any proposed financial settlement, they may not only suggest it's better to walk away with no deal, but attempt to apply pressure to this end. That in turn might lead to the largely self-muting Remainers in her ranks to find their voice. And there are more time bombs in Tusk's draft guidelines. If Theresa May wants a transitional deal, she will have to accept a ""supervisory"" regime for a time - presumably the European Court of Justice whose jurisdiction she wants to end. So UKIP are likely to claim by the next election that we are still ""half-in, half out"". And with the EU refusing to do a final trade deal until after the UK has left, it may be difficult for her to demonstrate the benefits of leaving - allowing the Liberal Democrats to claim we should never have cast aside single market membership in the first place.

103,31129877,"Mears Scotland has held the contract with the council for four years. Mears was losing money on the work and councillors will be urged to allow the contract to be renegotiated. The future of the contract has been caught up in in-fighting between some Labour councillors. Critics believe the work should be put out to tender to give others the chance to compete. The boss of Mears Scotland, Willie Docherty, is a personal friend of the council leader Jim McCabe, one of Scotland's longest-serving Labour councillors. Mr McCabe says he has been open about his friendship with Mr Docherty, whose wife Sadie is the Lord Provost of Glasgow, but insists that would not affect his judgement on the contract. Recently, Labour councillor Tommy Morgan - who had asked some tough questions over the contract - lost his position as convener of the council's audit and governance panel after a vote of confidence. This was over a group disciplinary matter unconnected with the Mears contract. Mr Morgan also became involved in a heated discussion with other councillors over a proposed school closure. With allegations of in-fighting between Labour councillors, the highly-charged atmosphere before the general election has also cast a shadow on the affair. Labour has an overall majority on North Lanarkshire Council and holds all the Westminster constituencies in the area. However, the area voted Yes in the independence referendum and the SNP has high hopes locally. Morrison Scotland, which was 30% owned by the council, won the contract when it was tendered four years ago. The company was later taken over by Mears. Under the terms of the contract, the company was expected to deliver efficiency savings every year. The council says Mears has improved the council's repairs service but was losing money on the contract - in part because it had been expected to find efficiency savings every year. Councillors on the Policy and Resources Committee are expected to vote to allow the contract to be renegotiated. Other options which were considered included re-tendering or going for a piecemeal approach to repairs. Council officers believe these options are riskier, could end up costing more than renegotiation, and are more likely to lead to a legal challenge.","Mears was losing money on the work and councillors will be urged to allow the contract to be renegotiated. Mr McCabe says he has been open about his friendship with Mr Docherty, whose wife Sadie is the Lord Provost of Glasgow, but insists that would not affect his judgement on the contract. Recently, Labour councillor Tommy Morgan - who had asked some tough questions over the contract - lost his position as convener of the council's audit and governance panel after a vote of confidence. This was over a group disciplinary matter unconnected with the Mears contract. The company was later taken over by Mears. The council says Mears has improved the council's repairs service but was losing money on the contract - in part because it had been expected to find efficiency savings every year.

The trains are for the first phase of the project, due to open in 2026 and run between London and Birmingham. Construction will begin later this year and it is expected to reduce rail times between Birmingham and London by 32 minutes. A second Y-shaped phase of HS2 will open in two stages. The line from Birmingham to Crewe will launch in 2027, with the remaining construction - which includes a spur taking HS2 to a new station at Manchester Airport - due to finish six years later. There will be separate contracts in the future to supply trains for this phase. Transport secretary Chris Grayling said the new railway would carry more than 300,000 people a day. ""Hundreds of jobs will be created in building and maintaining these trains, representing a great opportunity for British-based businesses and suppliers. ""In total 25,000 jobs and 2,000 apprenticeships will be created during HS2 construction and we have held discussions with UK suppliers to make sure they are in the best possible position to win contracts,"" he added. Friday's launch comes ahead of a formal start of the process in spring 2017, when companies interested in bidding can learn more about the process. Formal invitations to tender will be made in 2018. Hitachi Rail Europe said it will bid for the contract to build the HS2 trains. The rail manufacturer is headquartered in London and builds trains at its plant in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham. Its sales director, Nick Hughes, said: ""Our HS2 trains would be built in Britain, for Britain, and combine world-leading Japanese Shinkansen technology with British manufacturing know-how.""

107,35542850,"There has been continued sniping from ministers about the level of reserves held by higher education institutions. Even the finance minister Jane Hutt couldn't resist having a swipe at the hundreds of millions of pounds in their coffers, before telling Good Morning Wales why she is rolling back on the proposed cutbacks because of concerns over part-time teaching and scientific research. Ministers stressed it was a draft budget and, like all drafts, it was open to consultation before changes were made. Be that as it may, there is clearly strong feeling within government that not only can universities afford it, but that their time has come to take a hit after further education colleges took one last year. Universities insist the reserves are needed for investment to continue and for the sector in Wales to remain internationally competitive. The stand-off between ministers and vice-chancellors was beginning to develop. Opposition parties were frustrated that while many of the higher education bosses were lobbying them heavily, they weren't doing so publicly, with the exception of Professor Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff university. But nevertheless it was clear that universities weren't happy, and it was adding to the simmering resentment that had already developed over the government's university tuition fee policy. In fact, the general cut and the tuition fees policy became enmeshed because the Welsh government had argued that much of the cash reduction was in fact staying in the system because the money was being re-directed to fee subsidies, rather than going directly to the institutions. The comeback from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales was that only around 60% of the tuition fee grants will stay in Wales as the fees follow the students, wherever they choose to go. In the end, a political decision was taken not to get involved in a scrap with vice-chancellors. As we head into an election campaign, there's an argument to say it would have been a huge distraction but also a potential opportunity for the Welsh government to show it wasn't afraid to make unpopular decisions. Labour want the headlines from their latest budget to be about the extra money going into the NHS, and not a fight over funding for scientific research. It didn't work yesterday but that is one day, rather than a lingering dispute lasting weeks.","There has been continued sniping from ministers about the level of reserves held by higher education institutions.

111,34787422,"Observations with Japan's Subaru telescope reveal the likely icy body to be some 15.5 billion km from the Sun - about three times further away than even far-flung Pluto. Scientists say their initial studies suggest that the object - catalogued as V774104 - is some 500-1,000km across. It will need to be tracked over time to learn the shape and extent of its orbit through the Solar System. The discovery was announced at the 47th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences, taking place in National Harbor near Washington DC. The team behind the find is led by Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, and Chad Trujillo, from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. They specialise in detecting Solar System outliers. The previously recognised most distant object is the dwarf planet Eris. This body, which has a moon, Dysnomia, moves between 5.7 billion km and 14.6 billion km from the Sun. To put some of these numbers in context: Earth is 149 million km from the Sun, and even the most distant major planet - Neptune - seems close at 4.5 billion km, by these standards. That said, the Voyager 1 probe is further away - just. The epic robotic explorer has now ventured 20 billion km from home. The big question is whether V774104 sweeps inwards from its present location, like Eris, or outwards, like the objects known as 2012 VP113 and Sedna. These bodies are currently slightly closer in than Eris, but investigations of their orbits show they will reach far deeper into space, out to 66 billion km and 140 billion km, respectively. Models for Solar System formation suggest that such objects were probably not created in these weird, eccentric orbits. One explanation is that they have been perturbed gravitationally and pulled on to their strange trajectories by a passing planet - perhaps one that was expelled from our Solar System early in its history. Some scientists even speculate that such objects could have been stolen from a star that formed from the same ""nursery"" of gas and dust as our Sun 4.6 billion years ago.

115,16205674,"Snibston Discovery Museum, which is based at a former colliery, showcases the area's industrial heritage. But the withdrawal of a £4m Heritage Lottery Fund bid has prompted fears within the museum community that the centre could be in danger. The county council said the funding came with strings attached and Snibston was part of a wider review of museums. The award-winning museum is the most visited in the county, but some of the buildings were included on English Heritage's most recent At Risk register. The funding bid had been for a £5m project called Mining Lives, which would have improved the condition of the colliery buildings and increased public access to the site. Mark Taylor, from the Museums Association, said: ""I just hope they have thought this through and they have left room to change their minds. ""Because it seems to me that when you are going to get £5m to improve your flagship museum it breaks your heart if you have to send that back, especially if the real reason is that you want to close that museum."" The council, which needs to save to save £95m, said a review of the county's museums was taking place but there were no plans to close the centre. A Heritage Lottery Fund statement said: ""As well as providing support to address the extensive repair needs of the scheduled ancient monument, the project would have created much-needed training opportunities for local people. ""The decision not to take this project forward is therefore very disappointing."" It added: ""Our concern now is that the colliery buildings remain at risk, and we look forward to hearing from Leicestershire County Council what plans it has for the future of Snibston and the Scheduled Ancient Monument."" The county council's deputy leader, Nick Rushton, said accepting the money would bind them to conditions which meant they would be unable to properly review ways of saving money on site. ""I just dare not take this £4m from the Heritage Lottery Fund at this moment in time,"" he said. ""I have a big review ongoing at the moment of all arts, libraries and museums.

116,27559533,"Rajab, who heads the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), was convicted in 2012 of taking part in illegal gatherings and disturbing public order. An appeals court later reduced his original three-year term by a year. He was one of several leading activists arrested by the authorities after pro-democracy protests erupted in 2011. Soon after his release on Saturday, Rajab told the Associated Press news agency that he was happy to be out after spending more than 600 days in prison. He also appealed for the release of all political prisoners, the agency added. Rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights First, have campaigned on behalf of Rajab throughout his prison sentence, calling on the authorities to release him. In December 2013, a Bahraini court rejected a request by Rajab's lawyers for early release. They argued that he was eligible because he had already served three-quarters of a two-year sentence. In addition to his role with the BCHR, Mr Rajab is deputy secretary general of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH). Before his imprisonment in July 2012, Mr Rajab was repeatedly detained in connection with the pro-democracy protests that erupted in the Gulf kingdom the previous year. Amnesty said that he was punched in the face several times by riot police as he led a demonstration in February 2012, and in May 2012 was charged with ""insulting a national institution"" in comments about the interior ministry he posted on Twitter. In June 2012, Rajab was sentenced to three months in jail over different tweets he wrote about the prime minister. The conviction was eventually overturned on appeal, but only after he had begun his two-year sentence for taking part in unauthorised protests. At his trial, Mr Rajab told the court that he had been held in dire conditions and subjected to ill treatment, including being placed in solitary confinement with a dead animal and kept almost naked. BCHR's founder, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, is serving a life sentence for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government.

The inquest into her death will look into whether failures by the government and the police contributed to her death and will examine why Zalkalns was allowed to live unchecked in the UK. Reading from a prepared statement at the inquest at the Royal Courts of Justice, Alice's mother Rosalind Hodgkiss said the family wanted to ""establish whether or not the systems for monitoring foreign offenders and cross-border sharing of information are robust"". She added: ""We appreciate that they may have changed significantly, but we remain stunned that a foreign national with a conviction for murder was not monitored, or even known about in any way. ""This has destroyed much of our faith in our country's ability to protect its citizens.

He concluded she had been sexually assaulted and asphyxiated, probably by being prevented from breathing by a larger person pressing on her torso.

119,17674554,"His daughter said he had died at Val de Grace military hospital in Paris on Tuesday evening. Raymond Aubrac and his late wife Lucie became important members of Jean Moulin's underground Resistance movement in 1942. Aubrac was arrested in June 1943 with Moulin, who died after torture. In a recent BBC interview, he described how their arrests by the Gestapo at a doctor's surgery in the suburb of Caluire in Lyon had come as ""a shock but not a surprise"". Jean Moulin, who had been sent by Gen Charles de Gaulle to organise the underground resistance to Nazi occupation, was tortured, taken to Paris and later died on a train to Berlin. But Raymond Aubrac escaped when a group of fighters including his wife attacked a lorry moving him and other members of the Resistance from jail in Lyon. Born as Raymond Samuel in 1914, Aubrac was Jewish. He studied engineering and married Lucie Bernard after war broke out. After his escape from jail, the couple reached London in February 1944. Their story and their Resistance work with Jean Moulin became legendary in France and the couple gave a number of talks to schools and colleges about their experience. After France was liberated, Aubrac was given the task of supervising reconstruction efforts in the port city of Marseille. From 1964-75 he served as a director at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. He twice gave evidence after the war against Rene Hardy, a fellow Resistance member who was accused of betraying his colleagues but was later acquitted. In 2010, he travelled to London with President Nicolas Sarkozy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Gen de Gaulle's appeal to the French people after the country had fallen to the Nazis.

The result comes a day after the bank confirmed Jes Staley would be joining as its new chief executive. Barclays said it had seen slow progress with its so-called non-core businesses, which it is selling. Losses for the package of businesses, which includes some investment bank assets and parts of the European retail banking operation, more than doubled to £337m. Barclays provided £270m to settle claims in the US over mortgage bonds and £290m to compensate clients over bad foreign exchange rates.

Revenues dipped to £6.1bn from £6.4bn for the June-to-September period. On Wednesday, Barclays announced that Mr Staley will be joining the bank as its new chief in December. Mr Staley currently works for US hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital Management, and previously has worked for JP Morgan. Barclays' previous chief executive, Antony Jenkins, was fired in July after falling out with board members. Mr Staley will be paid £1.2m in salary, £396,000 in pension contributions and as much as £5.5m a year in bonuses, which will mostly be paid in shares. He will also receive £1.15m in shares per year that he will have to keep for five years before cashing in. That is a total of £8.2m for the year, if he is awarded the maximum bonus. He will also receive shares in Barclays worth about £1.93m to replace shares in JPMorgan he will lose for leaving his former employer. In a letter to staff on Wednesday, Mr Staley indicated he would focus on areas of investment banking that did not require as much capital - the buffer of reserves it keeps to protect it from unexpected losses.

125,16228680,"Judge Carlos Castro Martins reversed the order he had issued in September, which had barred any work on the Belo Monte dam that interfered with the natural flow of the Xingu river. He said the company behind the project had subsequently shown its work would not harm local fishing. The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists. Judge Martins had originally ruled in favour of a fisheries group which argued that the dam would affect local fish stocks and could harm indigenous families who make a living from fishing. He had barred the Norte Energia company behind the project from all work which could interfere with the natural flow of the Xingu river, including building a port, using explosives, installing dikes and building canals. Legal wrangling Norte Energia appealed against the decision and Judge Martins ruled on Friday that construction work on the dam could go ahead as the company had shown that local fishing boats would not be blocked or hindered in their work. ""Since the course of the water won't be altered, and there won't be much variation in the speed of its flow, (the project) won't have a major influence on the habitat of ornamental fish species used for fishing,"" he said. Judge Martins did, however, say that the wider environmental impact of the project ""could only be felt and analysed once the work was completed, as the studies into its effects were only forecasts of what could happen"". He also said that any work would have to comply with the regulations laid down by Brazil's Indian Affairs Department (Funai) and the National Environment Agency, Ibama. Norte Energia said the temporary halt on the building work had not affected the project, as it had not yet reached the stage where the company needed to do any of the specific type of work which had fallen under the ban. If it goes ahead, the 11,000-megawatt dam will be the third biggest in the world - after the Three Gorges in China and Itaipu, which is jointly run by Brazil and Paraguay. The government says it is crucial to meeting growing energy needs, but environmentalists and those fighting for indigenous rights have been vociferous in their opposition.","He said the company behind the project had subsequently shown its work would not harm local fishing.

McGregor, 28, danced around the stage as he criticised 40-year-old Mayweather and his promoters. The pair will meet over 12 rounds under boxing rules on 26 August. In a series of expletive-laden outbursts, mixed martial arts star McGregor insulted Mayweather over his outfit and even suggested he couldn't read. ""How do I look?"" McGregor asked the crowd, before pointing at Mayweather's bag. ""He's 40! Dress your age, carrying a school bag on stage. ""What are you doing with a school bag on stage? You can't even read."" Mayweather, dressed in a T-shirt and cap while McGregor wore a suit, replied: ""I'm the one that can't read? I do numbers, I make money,"" ""You owe money,"" McGregor responded, referring to reports that Mayweather asked the IRS earlier this month for more time to pay his 2015 tax bill. Undefeated Mayweather took an Irish flag from the crowd and paraded it in front of McGregor, before the Irishman threw it back in the boxer's face. Their head-to-head meeting was the second in a four-day international tour to four cities to promote the bout taking place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The first publicity event took place in Los Angeles, where McGregor promised to knock out Mayweather inside four rounds, with the final two events taking place in New York and London. McGregor has never boxed as an amateur or professional. But his UFC coach John Kavanagh says the Irishman's boxing skills are improving all the time. Kavanagh said: ""We have gone through one training cycle and we had some good sparring partners in - and, as we expected, his skills transcended. ""He is not trying to win Wimbledon. It's not that different. ""His understanding of range, his understanding of how to move around is excellent.""

127,35428837,"Two reports, published in November, criticised the regulator at the time for failing to take action. One of those reports, by barrister Andrew Green QC, said regulators should consider banning 10 former HBOS executives. A new investigation has now been announced by regulators. ""The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have decided to start investigations into certain former HBOS senior managers,"" the regulators said. ""These investigations will determine whether or not any prohibition proceedings should be commenced against them. The FCA and PRA continue to review materials with a view to making further decisions regarding other former HBOS senior managers."" No details are being given as to the exact nature of the investigations, who is being investigated, or the timeframe of the inquiry. A Bank of England/FCA report examined the failure of HBOS, while Mr Green examined decisions taken by the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator at the time of the HBOS demise. Both were published in November. So far the only person to have been banned is Peter Cummings, who was previously the head of corporate lending at HBOS. In 2012, he was fined Â£500,000, and banned from senior positions in banking. In his report, Mr Green suggested that the Bank of England's PRA and the FCA should consider prohibition proceedings against former executives. That included Andy Hornby, HBOS chief executive from 2006 to 2009. Mr Green said the FSA was ""misguided"" when it took the decision not to take action against Mr Hornby. Other former HBOS executives named in the report included Lord Stevenson, and Mike Ellis, the former group finance director at HBOS. Lindsay Mackay, the head of HBOS's Treasury division from 2004, could also be banned, November's report said. James Crosby, HBOS chief executive from 2001 to 2006, has retired. He gave up his knighthood in 2009, and surrendered part of his pension. Eight former non-executive directors of HBOS were criticised in the report, although they said they disagreed with its findings.

129,20602953,"The 61-38 vote on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities meant the treaty failed to reach the two-thirds majority needed. Disabled former senator and Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole, who uses a wheelchair, appeared on the floor of the Senate in support. The treaty was signed by 155 nations and ratified by 126, including Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. It says all nations should work to ensure that disabled people enjoy the same rights and freedoms as other citizens. The treaty was backed by Mr Dole, who was disabled in World War II, Arizona Senator John McCain, who sustained disabling injuries in the Vietnam War, Indiana Senator Richard Lugar, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, and former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. However, only eight Republican senators voted in favour of the treaty. Others, like Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe, said they voted against the measure because of the extra regulation it would bring with it. ""I do not support the cumbersome regulations and potentially overzealous international organisations with anti-American biases that infringe upon American society,"" Mr Inhofe said. The White House said it was ""disappointed"" that the ""overwhelming majority"" of Senate Republicans voted against the treaty. Ratification of the treaty ""would position the United States to support extending across the globe the rights that Americans already enjoy at home. This in turn would improve the lives of Americans with disabilities"" who choose to live or travel abroad, the White House added. Massachusetts Democratic Senator John Kerry, who backed the treaty, said: ""It really isn't controversial. ""What this treaty says is very simple.

Following his arrest on 30 October, he was handed to police for interrogation and died on 3 November. The exact circumstances of his death remain unclear. Some reports have suggested he was tortured. The Tehran prosecutor's office says the main cause of Mr Beheshti's death could be physical shock - caused by the brute force applied to sensitive parts of his torso - or psychological pressure. ""It is not possible to determine the exact cause of death,"" it said in a statement quoted by Irna news agency. ""But the most likely cause leading to death may be shock."" The statement notes that a thorough forensic investigation has been carried out and that prosecutors have obtained witness statements from Mr Beheshti's inmates and prison wardens. Neither the statements nor the forensic results are in the public domain. An earlier coroner's report said his body had ""signs of wounds"" but no broken bones, according to the semi-official news agency Mehr. Mr Beheshti's death sparked an international outcry. Last week, three people were reported to have been arrested and subsequently, according to an opposition website, released. According to opposition website, Kalameh, the suspects had been involved in Mr Beheshti's interrogation. Mr Beheshti's mother has been forbidden to speak to the press. But an opposition website quoted her as saying she had been offered ""blood money"" in compensation. She added: ""I said I didn't want any.

The OU's Prof John Domingue told the BBC: ""This has been developed as a tool for tutors to help students. ""We are planning to use this data for students studying in 2015-16."" The programme, called OU Analyse, was developed at the university during the 2013-14 academic year. It uses a variety of data sets held by the OU and assesses the likelihood of a student submitting their next assignment by using information gathered from four different algorithms. The more algorithms that indicate the student will not send in their work - the higher the chance of that happening. Prof Domingue added: ""We take advantage of the fact that modules are presented many times. One can use the experience of previous students to benefit future students. An interesting fact is that the data of the interactions before the course actually starts, like reading the material available and engaging with forums, is extremely valuable. ""Currently it is deployed on 13 modules, mostly level one modules in order to try to provide timely indicators that students may be struggling. ""The model is tailored to each of the modules and by using this and identifying students, more tailored support may be provided.""

134,38461691,"German state prosecutors said they had found the man's number on the phone of Anis Amri, who killed 12 people by ramming a lorry into market shoppers. Amri was shot dead by police in Milan early last Friday, four days on from the attack. The 24-year-old Tunisian had opened fire, wounding one. Amri had links to known Islamists. German prosecutors say a video in which Amri pledges allegiance to so-called Islamic State (IS) is genuine. Government officials have said the lorry's automatic braking system may have prevented the loss of more lives on 19 December. The system kicks in when it senses an impact and this may have cut the hijacker's rampage short. Frauke Koehler, spokesperson for the federal prosecutor's office, said ""further investigations revealed that the detained man was not a contact person of Anis Amri's, therefore he had to be released"". She said the pistol found on Amri when he was shot dead by Italian police last week had the same calibre as the one that killed the Polish driver whose truck Amri hijacked. Lukasz Urban, 37, was killed by a gunshot to the head - apparently before the lorry was driven into the Christmas crowd at Breitscheidplatz, in central Berlin. His body was found in the cabin, after Amri had fled. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni told a news conference there was no evidence that Amri had any ""particular networks"" in Italy. He was probably radicalised after arriving in Italy in 2011, Mr Gentiloni said. Investigators are trying to piece together Amri's movements after the Berlin attack, when he was subject to a European arrest warrant. There are indications that he travelled to Nijmegen in the Netherlands on 21 December and then took an overnight bus from Amsterdam to Lyon in France. Then he took a train to Chambery in the French Alps, changed trains, and reached Milan.

""And this is where the naive bit comes in, she didn't even rip it open to make sure there were headphones in there."" They said she was being held at El Buen Pastor, Colombia's largest women's prison. The family has started an online campaign to help cover legal fees, raising A$2,600 (Â£1,500; $2,000) in four days. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs in Colombia are severe and offenders can expect long prison sentences under harsh conditions. According to Ms Evans, Ms Sainsbury's lawyer has recommended a guilty plea to avoid a maximum sentence up to 25 years in jail. If Ms Sainsbury pleads guilty, she would face a six-year sentence, which could be reduced further if she gives information about the man who supplied the headphones, Ms Evans said.

Tannoy is one of the oldest audio brands in the world, having been founded as the Tulsemere Manufacturing Company in 1926. It has had a base in Coatbridge since the 1970s. The company remains active in a range of audio sectors including residential hi-fi and studio monitoring.

""In the event that the proposed dismissals are ultimately confirmed following the conclusion of the consultation process, the Coatbridge facility would cease operations and the plant would close. ""Given that the proposals are at a formative stage, there is of course no definitive time scale in place, but it is envisaged that any closure would likely be towards the end of the year.""

But Corinthians said there was not enough time to sign the the 27-year-old before the Brazilian transfer window closes at 0400 BST on Thursday. Corinthians still want Tevez and hinted an agreement can be reached in January. It had appeared that the former West Ham forward had got his wish for a transfer but then in a statement, Corinthians said: ""The board of Sporting Club Corinthians hereby officially announce the impossibility of hiring the Argentine striker Carlos Tevez. ""While acknowledging the efforts of Manchester City and all involved in the negotiation, more time is needed for the transfer to be achieved, given that the window to sign players from abroad closes on Wednesday, 20 July [Brazilian time]. ""We are aware of the dream our fans had of having this player at Corinthians again and we look forward to him being with us in the near future."" That would indicate that Corinthians may look to revive the deal in the January transfer window, although that would not be the preferred option of Tevez or his current club. Tevez, who had a spell at Corinthians from 2005 to 2006, originally asked City for a transfer in December and has since reiterated that desire to leave so he can be closer to his family in Argentina.

146,38438714,"Mr Abe will be accompanied by US President Barack Obama, making the visit the first by the leaders of both countries since the attack. Mr Abe will pray for the dead but will not issue an apology, his aides said. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour killed 2,300 US servicemen and propelled the US into World War Two. After landing, the Japanese prime minister first headed to National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, and laid down a wreath. He stood for a moment of silence at the cemetery near downtown Honolulu, a memorial to those who died. All eight battleships at the base were damaged and four were sunk. But the key US aircraft carriers were at sea at the time. On Tuesday, Mr Abe and Mr Obama will pray for the dead at the site of the attack before holding a summit meeting in Hawaii, their last before Mr Obama steps down in January. Mr Abe's visit, three weeks after the 75th anniversary of the attack, follows a visit earlier this year to Hiroshima by Mr Obama. He became the first serving US president to visit the Japanese city, where about 150,000 people are believed to have been killed in 1945 by a US atomic bomb. 353 Japanese aircraft attacked the US Naval Base in Hawaii at 07:55 2,403 US personnel were killed in the attack 19 US Navy ships, including 8 battleships, were damaged or destroyed 328 US aircraft were damaged or destroyed in the attack, which lasted for one hour and 15 minutes The first Japanese leader to visit Pearl Harbor was Shigeru Yoshida who in 1951 stopped over in Hawaii both on the way to and from the signing of the peace treaty with the US in San Francisco. His visit on the way home included a meeting with the commander of the US Pacific fleet, Admiral Arthur Radford. The office where the two men met offered a direct view of the site of the Japanese attack. ""I could almost see the wreck of Arizona"" out of the window, Mr Radford later wrote in his memoir, referring to a battleship that sank in the attack. He recalled the meeting as having been initially rather awkward until his dog walked over to the Japanese visitor to be patted, breaking the ice between the two former enemies.","The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour killed 2,300 US servicemen and propelled the US into World War Two.

A new UK cabinet committee chaired by Commons Leader William Hague will now meet for the first time on Wednesday. Mr Crabb's comments come as Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones called for a convention on future of the UK. Speaking on Tuesday at the Labour Party conference, Mr Jones said the union cannot be rebuilt through conversation between only Westminster and Scotland. Now the Welsh secretary has pledged to keep Wales at the discussion table on the future of devolved powers across Britain. Mr Crabb said he had already held preliminary discussions with Mr Hague, a former Welsh secretary himself. ""We are both in absolute agreement that Wales should be central to the debate that is now commencing,"" said Mr Crabb. ""I want us to use this opportunity positively to look again at how we secure the best possible devolution settlement for Wales. ""I want to move forward in a realistic, open-minded and pragmatic way."" Mr Crabb has written to the leaders of other Welsh parties at Westminster inviting them to a Wales Office ""summit"" to discuss ""how we deliver devolution that works for Wales"". The meeting is likely to take place when parliament returns next month. He said he is also arranging meetings with party leaders in the National Assembly to ensure their views feed into the debate. The comments from Mr Crabb came as Prime Minister David Cameron hosted discussions with backbench Tory MPs at his Chequers country residence. One of the two Welsh MPs to attend was the Aberconway MP, Guto Bebb. He said events in Scotland have ""completely changed the nature of the debate"" on devolution. Key to Monday's talks have been the issue of ""English votes for English laws"", which would see Welsh and Scottish MPs excluded from voting on devolved matters in the House of Commons. That has led to Labour Party leader Ed Miliband accusing Mr Cameron of planning to set the UK nations against each other. But the Aberconway MP said he took a different view. ""The promises made to Scotland must be delivered upon and if they are delivered on then we are going to end up in my view with English votes for English laws and that in my view is a simple matter of fairness,"" said Mr Bebb.","A new UK cabinet committee chaired by Commons Leader William Hague will now meet for the first time on Wednesday.

It will come in to force on 1 June, in time for the World Cup in Brazil. The new law was proposed by the Football Association and will apply to domestic and international football. FA general secretary Alex Horne said: ""The idea is to get some consistency. The simplest rule for the image of the game is to start from the basis that slogans will not be allowed."" From the time the new rule comes in to place, incidents such as Mario Balotelli's infamous ""Why Always Me?"" message, which he revealed after scoring against Manchester United in 2011, will be banned and subject to a sanction.

150,31970403,"The force backed down from its policy of arming some officers for routine duties following a backlash last year. Giving evidence at Holyrood, Assistant Chief Constable Bernie Higgins said armed officers were among the best trained in the force. But he accepted police intelligence could sometimes get it wrong. Assistant Chief Constable Higgins told Holyrood's justice sub-committee that during a recent incident in Edinburgh two armed officers were confronted with a man wielding a knife. One was stabbed four times, he said, but the officers did not shoot the attacker because they feared it would put members of the public standing nearby at risk. Assistant Chief Constable Higgins said in another instance armed officers had comforted an injured pensioner in the street and intervened to prevent street brawls developing further. But he also confirmed that they had issued fixed penalties for public urination, drinking in the street and breach of the peace. In October, following pressure from politicians and civic society, Police Scotland said specialist armed police officers in Scotland would in future only be deployed to firearms incidents or where there is a threat to life. Earlier this month, in front of the same committee, Assistant Chief Constable Higgins said since October 2014 armed officers had ""engaged with the public"" on 1,644 occasions, including stopping drink-drivers and helping find missing people. He told MSPs then a review of the policy was currently being undertaken and was close to being finalised. During Thursday's session, Assistant Chief Constable Higgins also accepted criticism of police intelligence which led to a 91-year-old driver being ordered from his car at gunpoint by four armed officers. Mr Higgins said: ""Based on the information the firearms officers had that time, their actions were entirely appropriate. ""There was criticism of Police Scotland in terms of the intelligence that was held, the information that was held, and how quickly or otherwise that was passed to firearms officers."" Some MSPs raised concerns about armed police seen shopping in supermarkets. Police Scotland received more than 5,000 complaints since May in total, said Assistant Chief Constable Higgins, ranging from incivility to use of excessive force.","The force backed down from its policy of arming some officers for routine duties following a backlash last year.

151,35823970,"From April 2017, 600,000 small firms will not have to pay business rates, while 250,000 will pay lower rates. To fund the giveaway, the chancellor capped debt interest payments used by larger firms to cut their corporation tax bills, to 30% of earnings. George Osborne also said corporation tax would be cut to 17% by 2020. Mr Osborne said his business tax reforms were part of a ""Budget for small business"". The chancellor announced he was permanently raising the threshold for small business rate relief from £6,000 to a maximum of £15,000 and increasing higher rate relief from £18,000 to £51,000. He said that the 600,000 small businesses relieved of paying business rates from next April would see an annual saving of nearly £6,000. Mike Cherry, policy director at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""The chancellor has listened to our calls for the tax system to be made simpler for small businesses and the self-employed and taken important action on business rates."" The chancellor also announced a number of reforms designed to help small businesses cope with what he called ""the great unfairness"" they faced when trying to compete with some suppliers selling goods online. Mr Osborne said the government would take measures to stop overseas retailers storing goods in the UK and then selling the goods online without paying VAT. He also introduced two new tax-free allowances worth £1,000 a year for so-called micro-entrepreneurs: people who make money from occasional jobs or through renting out property they own. The Treasury estimates that the debt interest rate relief cap, alongside other measures, will help raise £8bn over the next five years. Among those other measures was the announcement that firms making an annual profit of over £5m would face the prospect of having the amount of past losses they could carry forward to offset their corporation tax bill capped to 50% of current profits. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI business lobby group, said: ""The reduction in the headline corporation tax rate sends out a strong signal that the UK is open for global business investment, and reforms to interest deductibility are rightly in line with the international consensus. But she added: ""Changes to the tax treatment of losses will make it harder for larger scale-up firms and companies that have been through tough times to play their part in the recovery.""","George Osborne also said corporation tax would be cut to 17% by 2020.

Robinson only signed a new three-year contract with the Ashton Gate side in August, but they have since lost all nine of their competitive fixtures - including two in the European Challenge Cup. A club statement said: ""Bristol Rugby have decided, following the extremely disappointing start to the season, to appoint Mark Tainton as acting head coach with immediate effect.""

Since Bristol's long-awaited return to the top flight began with an encouraging 21-19 loss at Harlequins on the opening day, both results and performances have failed to meet expectations. A heavy 70-22 defeat at Wasps on 18 September set the tone for a defence which has conceded 34 tries in seven league games.

BBC Radio 5 live rugby union reporter Chris Jones ""Bristol spent seven seasons down in the Championship, so it's no surprise that they have acted swiftly following their chastening start to their Premiership campaign. ""Although the club say Robinson is suspended, not sacked, it's hard to see him returning to take charge of team affairs, and it's likely the suspension is a case of negotiating severance. ""Mark Tainton will be acting head coach while a review is carried out, with Bristol needing a dramatic upturn in their fortunes on the pitch to avoid an immediate return to the second tier.""","Bristol have suspended director of rugby Andy Robinson pending a ""review of their coaching needs"", and placed coach Mark Tainton in interim charge.",510,266

But it will now continue beyond April until a new scheme, planned for 2018, is in place. The move was welcomed by NUS Wales but the Welsh Conservatives said the ""U-turn"" highlighted historical issues over the management of projects. MyTravelPass was established as part of a budget deal with the Liberal Democrats during the last assembly term. The Welsh Government announced the end of the scheme in January. The announcement was criticised by bus operators and other AMs, including Labour's Lynne Neagle. CPT Cymru, which represents the bus industry, said at the time of the decision to end the scheme, it had not been well publicised and that take-up had been low. The Welsh Government, at the time of announcing the end of the scheme, had said that it was only ever launched as a pilot with funding agreed until March 2017. It said initial analysis suggested that pass-holders were not using their passes to travel outside their immediate areas. But in a statement to assembly members, Economy Secretary Ken Skates said ""there is clearly an appetite in Wales for a scheme of this nature"". Mr Skates said he would launch a consultation into a new youth travel pass, which he intends to launch from 2018. The existing arrangements will continue to be available throughout Wales from 1 April 2017, the minister explained, adding he has asked CPT to come forward with proposals for a new marketing campaign. NUS Wales deputy president Carmen Smith welcomed the news but said the new scheme ""should be extended to all learners in further education and apprentices to the age of 25"". The Welsh Liberal Democrats also welcomed the move while Welsh Conservative spokesman for skills Mohammad Asghar called it an expected ""U-turn"". He said the move ""once again highlights historical issues within the economy department over its management and implementation of investments and projects"". A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We made clear at the time of the draft budget that as a result of the low take up of the pilot MyTravelPass, our intention was to develop a new discount scheme for young people that learned the lessons of the pilot and which could encourage more young people to use the bus network.

Vehicle manufacturers opposed the move, saying repair garages could fix any issues. The ruling follows claims the right to modify software could have prevented the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The Library of Congress, which oversees the US Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software, Reuters reported. Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation. ""Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented,"" the statement said. Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. But he added that some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright. Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are ""pervasive"" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices. ""We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers,"" said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes. In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions deceit, the EFF said car manufacturers' software should not be protected from independent scrutiny. ""When you entrust your health, safety, or privacy to a device, the law shouldn't punish you for trying to understand how that device works and whether it is trustworthy,"" Walsh blogged. The new rules must be renewed in three years, he said. Some US government agencies expressed serious reservations about the new rules, and the Environmental Protection Agency flatly opposed them. ""EPA explained that vehicle modifications are often performed to increase engine power or boost fuel economy, but that these modifications increase vehicle emissions and thus violate the Clean Air Act,"" the Library of Congress said in its final rule. However, the new rules do not allow vehicle owners to break any other laws, the Library said, and will not take effect for a year so the EPA and other agencies have time to prepare.","A ruling will allow users and expert analysts to carry out repairs.

160,36981189,"Carlos Ghosn said there was a need to build a ""much higher awareness"" of the company's products in Brazil. When Nissan took the decision to back the Games, the Brazilian market was booming with sales of 3.8 million vehicles a year. But a recession has seen that sales figure tumble to 2 million a year. ""Without any doubt it's the right decision, the idea was to give more awareness to the Nissan brand,"" he told the BBC. The company's goal with the Olympics sponsorship is to help increase its market-share in Brazil from 3% to 5%, he said. The 31st Olympic Games officially start in Rio on Friday with the opening ceremony at the Maracana Stadium. As part of its sponsorship, Nissan is supplying 5,000 cars for the Games and the Brazilian Olympic team to use. The company has used Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt in its adverts since 2012. Mr Ghosn says the global car market will continue to be sluggish until 2019, with growth of just 1% next year. He expects the US car market to be strong, and sees Europe continuing to recover ""even though it will be impacted by Brexit"". The UK economy will see some contraction due to Brexit, ""not because there is anything wrong with the UK, but because markets hate uncertainty,"" Mr Ghosn said. The company will be keeping a close eye on future negotiations over the UK's exit from the European Union. Nissan employs 6,700 staff at its plant in Sunderland in northern England. ""We are reasonably optimistic at the end of the day common sense will prevail from both sides,"" Mr Ghosn said. The Nissan boss thinks that the UK will continue to be a ""big partner"" for the European Union, but he said: ""The question is what will happen to customs, trade and circulation of products. ""That will determine how, and how much we will invest in the UK,"" he said. Mr Ghosn said there was ""no doubt"" that prices for Renaults, and other cars made in Europe and sold in the UK, will rise due to the falling value of the British pound.

161,30443351,"Debra Milke was freed in September 2013 after a record of misconduct by a key detective in the case emerged. The case against Ms Milke rested largely on a purported confession to that detective. An appeals court in Arizona ruled on Thursday that the she could not be tried again in relation to the killing. Prosecutors had pushed for a retrial but a panel of three judges said such a move would amount to double jeopardy. The two men who carried out the killing remain on death row. Debra Milke, then a 25-year-old insurance company clerk, was accused of dressing her son in his favourite outfit and telling him he was going to see Santa Claus at a local mall. Four-year-old Christoper Milke was then taken by two men to a desert area north of Phoenix where he was shot three times in the head. The original trial in 1990 found Ms Milke guilty of arranging the killing, based largely on an alleged confession made to Detective Armando Saldate. However, Mr Saldate did not record the confession and has since been implicated in several cases of misconduct including lying under oath. An appeals court ruled last year that prosecutors had known about Mr Saldate's misconduct but failed to disclose the information. ""Non-disclosure of this magnitude calls into question the integrity of the system and was highly prejudicial to Milke,"" the court said. Mr Saldate said he feared potential charges if he testified again, and in December a judge granted his request not to give evidence at any retrial. The court said on Thursday that it wasn't expressing an opinion on Milke's guilt or innocence but merely on the validity of a retrial. Ms Milke's ex-husband, Arizona Milke, remained convinced of her guilt. ""She shouldn't walk free, because she's guilty,"" he told the Associated Press. Lawyers for Ms Milke said they were ""thrilled"" at the decision not to allow a retrial.

In response to the charges she denies using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour and driving without reasonable consideration for other road users. Ms Pearson has admitted driving an unlicensed vehicle on the day in question. The defendant claimed Mr Vine was mistaken in what he thought he had seen and said she instead raised her middle finger at the presenter, who she thought was ""a bit crazy"" for following her after their initial row. Footage of the argument, which took place in Hornton Street, west London and was filmed on Mr Vine's helmet camera, has since been viewed online millions of times, the presenter said. The video was played in court. After initially clashing when Mr Vine stopped his bike in front of Ms Pearson's Vauxhall Corsa, Ms Pearson drove past the Radio Two presenter, the court learned. But the argument erupted a short while later when Ms Pearson spotted Mr Vine trying to take a photograph. Explaining the next few moments to the court, he said: ""She's gone back in the car, she's sitting at this junction. I am behind her with my cycle, the lights are red.

That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom."" Meanwhile, the head of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge, has suggested a new committee should be established to oversee the tax arrangements of major firms. She told the Independent newspaper that such a committee could hear evidence from companies in secret, meaning that companies would not be able to hide their tax affairs behind confidentiality rules.

Andrew Frangos of Cornhill Capital was approached by the three-time bankrupt Chappell to raise money secured against property to use as working capital - the money you need for day to day running of a company. Mr Frangos said that BHS was not the limit of his ambitions and that Chappell had plans to one day buy Arcadia - the parent company run by Sir Philip Green. Ultimately, Chappell didn't use Cornhill Capital and the two of them are in dispute over unpaid bills. He was joined in the commons by representatives from accountants Grant Thornton and lawyers Olswang to explain their involvement as advisers to Mr Chappell. Both made extensive use of client confidentiality protection but several important themes emerged. Retail Acquisitions Limited did not delve very deeply into the pension problems. Meetings between Chappell and the Chris Martin, chair of the BHS pension scheme, totalled less than half an hour and Grant Thornton's Mark Byers said he was denied the usual access to the pension trustees and their advisors. On the bigger picture, MPs asked what the professional advisers made of this ""punt"". Why did they believe that a retail novice with a chequered financial background could succeed in turning BHS around when a feted retail tycoon had failed? We got two interesting answers. First, a central part of the turnaround plan involved getting the landlords for the 164 stores to agree to reduce the rent. Mark Byers, from Grant Thornton said it would be difficult to have that negotiation, for BHS essentially to plead poverty, as long as BHS was part of the bigger Arcadia group. Second, it wasn't their job. So far there is no smoking gun. What is emerging from these sessions is that lots of professional firms were tasked with making sure small bits of the deal ticked a number of boxes. No one, it seems, was there to look Mr Chappell in the eye and judge whether he had the ability, or even the intention, of making BHS work. MPs will no doubt suggest that role fell to Sir Philip Green himself as the seller.

Kent Fire and Rescue Service managed to contain burning oil which spread on to adjacent land cleared for development. Firefighters said the blaze started at about 2300 BST and was finally brought under control at around 0545 BST. The fire started in two road tankers before spreading to plastic and steel drum oil containers. No casualties have been reported. At least 10 fire crews from around the county were tackling the fire, with extra foam units brought in from London and Essex. Graham Gash, area manager from Kent Fire and Rescue said: ""Crews have done a great job in fighting this serious fire and successfully managing to prevent it spreading further and damaging nearby buildings. ""We worked alongside our partners from the London Fire Brigade and Essex Fire and Rescue Service and I think praise goes to everyone for a job well done."" Mr Gash said crews were confronted by a very serious fire involving road tanker vehicles carrying 1,000-litre containers of reclaimed engine oil and numerous 200-litre barrels of oil which were exploding. He added: ""More importantly, we had fuel that was flowing from the site and this posed a significant threat to the surrounding building which was three industrial units."" The fire officer said foam had to be used to put out a very hot oil fire, while two high volume water supplies were needed for a major foam strike - one for cooling and one for foam production. He added: ""This particular area is not very well served with a good water supply so we had to run in two water mains from Kingsnorth power station."" By about 0800 BST on Saturday, fire crews had entered the turning over and damping down phase, Mr Gash said. He said crews were working to make sure the fire was out and checking the industrial units with thermal imaging cameras to make sure there had been no undetected fire spread. Mr Gash said there was minimal risk to people nearby because the industrial estate was surrounded by commercial industrial retail outlets and not residential areas.

175,33648595,"He owns the Japanese Nikkei group media house, which has just acquired the Financial Times from UK publishing group Pearson for $1.3bn (Â£844m). Nikkei is one of Japan's oldest and most prestigious newspaper groups, and has managed impressive staying power at a time when the industry is on the decline. The acquisition is being called a bold and brave move for Nikkei - and it is a strategy Mr Kita has been pursuing for some time. But little is known about the man behind the deal - except for the fact that in previous interviews he has alluded to the need for the Nikkei group to expand. However, analysts are wondering whether he has paid too high a price for the luxury of owning the FT - three times as much as it is thought the pink paper is worth. But it is the FT's digital success that Nikkei wants to emulate. In 2014 Mr Kita told a group of newspaper distributors and vendors that Nikkei had to strengthen sales and secure revenue in the light of decreasing print circulation figures. He is also a big believer in the digital subscription model - a natural synergy, then, with the FT, which now derives 70% of its business from its online and mobile audiences. And he has long held global ambitions for the firm. In 2012 Mr Kita reportedly said that he wanted to make Nikkei a global company, in the same way as the Japanese convenience store sector, which has had success in foreign markets. The acquisition of the FT allows him to realise those ambitions. But how will the two cultures of the two media houses merge? Critics say Nikkei is often a public relations machine for Japanese corporates - and that will clash with the fiercely independent Financial Times. The Nikkei group has steered clear of recent Japanese corporate scandals like Toshiba's earnings debacle and the Olympus accounting fiasco in 2011 - a story the FT broke. FT Editor Lionel Barber has assured his staff that the paper's editorial integrity will not be compromised - no matter how high the price-tag.","Nikkei is one of Japan's oldest and most prestigious newspaper groups, and has managed impressive staying power at a time when the industry is on the decline.

176,19436926,"However, researchers at the University of Bristol believe the shape of beer glasses affects the speed people drink. Their study, published in the journal PLoS ONE, suggests people drink more quickly out of curved glasses than straight ones. They argue that the curvy glassware makes pacing yourself a much greater challenge. A group of 159 men and women were filmed drinking either soft drinks or beer as part of the study. The glasses all contained around half a pint of liquid, but some of the glasses were straight while others were very curved. There was no difference in the drinking time for soft drinks. People drinking from both straight and curved glasses finished after around seven minutes. However, for the beer drinkers there was a large difference between the two groups. While it took around seven minutes for people drinking from a curved glass to polish off their half pint, it took 11 minutes for those drinking from a straight glass. The report said: ""Drinking time is slowed by almost 60% when an alcoholic beverage is presented in a straight glass compared with a curved glass."" The researchers thought that curvy glasses made it harder to pace drinking because judging how much was in the glass became more difficult owing to its curved shape. The group of drinkers was shown a variety of pictures of partially-filled beer glasses and asked to say whether they were more or less than half full. The team said people were more likely to get the answer wrong when assessing the amount of liquid in curved glasses. The lead researcher Dr Angela Attwood told the BBC: ""They are unable to judge how quickly they are drinking so cannot pace themselves."" She suggested that people were not concerned about pacing themselves with soft drinks, which could explain why glass shape had no effect on them. However, the study looked only at the time taken to finish one drink in a laboratory setting. So it is not certain what happens on an evening out if multiple drinks are consumed. She said altering the glasses used in pubs could ""nudge"" people to drink more healthily by ""giving control back"". The shape of a glass has already been shown to affect how much alcohol people pour. A study in 2005 showed people were more likely to pour extra alcohol into short, wide glasses than tall, narrow ones.","Their study, published in the journal PLoS ONE, suggests people drink more quickly out of curved glasses than straight ones.

She suggested that people were not concerned about pacing themselves with soft drinks, which could explain why glass shape had no effect on them. So it is not certain what happens on an evening out if multiple drinks are consumed. She said altering the glasses used in pubs could ""nudge"" people to drink more healthily by ""giving control back"". The shape of a glass has already been shown to affect how much alcohol people pour. A study in 2005 showed people were more likely to pour extra alcohol into short, wide glasses than tall, narrow ones.",The shape of your glass is probably the last thing on your mind when you are down the pub.,493,249

Farmers said some were unable to control their dogs around livestock and let the pets run through crops. The advice includes opening up less sensitive areas to dog walkers rather than trying to ban them completely. Drawing on the experiences of farmers and estate owners, the guidance also encourages landowners to explain why certain places should be avoided. The reasons include ground-nesting birds using the land and areas being used for rearing young lambs or calves. NFU Scotland, Scottish Land and Estates, The Kennel Club and The Scottish Kennel Club were consulted by SNH. Bridget Finton, SNH recreation and access officer, said almost four million adults visited Scotland's outdoors every year and about 48% of those people brought a dog with them. She said: ""These high numbers show how dog walking helps lots of people get healthy outdoor activity, but it's really important to minimise the number of occasions when dogs cause land managers' concerns.

182,33612925,"Peers defied the government by backing calls to set up a joint parliamentary committee to look at the proposals. Lord Lawson and Lord Forsyth were among Conservative peers to rebel as the government lost by 320 votes to 139. Ministers have had to redraft plans to give English MPs an effective veto on laws deemed to apply to England only and to delay a vote amid opposition. The Conservatives made a manifesto commitment to give English MPs a decisive say over legislation exclusively affecting England but have run into trouble over the details of the plan and how it will be introduced. The plan is for a new Commons stage to be introduced for laws passing through Parliament with England's MPs asked to accept or veto legislation only affecting England before it passes to a vote of all UK MPs at third reading. Ministers say this will address the longstanding anomaly by which Scottish MPs can vote on issues such as health and education affecting England but English MPs have no say on similar matters relating to Scotland, where such policies are devolved. A similar process would be used, including Welsh MPs, where matters covered only England and Wales. But the SNP has said they will be excluded them from votes on matters affecting Scotland and create two classes of MP in the Commons while Labour has said the proposals are being rushed and need more detailed scrutiny. Peers have now backed calls by Lord Butler, the former cabinet secretary and crossbench peer, for a special committee of MPs and peers to look into the proposals in depth. Lord Butler said he backed the principle of requiring laws affecting England to have the consent of a majority of English MPs but there were better ways of approaching what has long been known as the ""West Lothian question"" ""Surely it is more important to get the proposals right than to rush them through,"" he said. The vote does not bind the government unless the House of Commons also agrees to such a move. The Leader of the Lords, Lady Stowell, maintained that peers would get a debate on the plans in the autumn, but after 30 years of trying to find a solution to the problem of English-only laws it was time to take action. ""There does come a point where we need to stop talking and get on with taking some action,"" she said.","The plan is for a new Commons stage to be introduced for laws passing through Parliament with England's MPs asked to accept or veto legislation only affecting England before it passes to a vote of all UK MPs at third reading.

The north African country had been planning to build 11 stadiums at a cost of $314 million, including a showpiece new 60,000-seater Austrian-built stadium on the site of a former military camp in Tripoli. Benghazi and Misrata were also set to have new major stadiums. Libya's government said last year it hoped the hosting of the Nations Cup would allow it to demonstrate that life had returned to normal in the country and encourage investors. Former World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer had accepted a role as an ""ambassador"" to help promote the tournament and the country and the former Spain coach Javier Clemente was hired to prepare their team for the tournament. Caf's decision follows the visit of a delegation from the Libyan FA to Caf's headquarters in Cairo this week.

But at a polling stations on Sunday, in relatively peaceful Mexico City, there was a sense of duty among many - that voting was the only way to make a difference. Asked what their main concern was and almost without exception, the response among voters was: 'Security.' People here are worried about where the country is heading. Despite President Pena Nieto's promises to restore peace in Mexico, these elections have proved otherwise. They have been some of the most violent in recent history.

197,38735808,"Counsel General Mick Antoniw said he was ""delighted"" by the Supreme Court ruling against the UK government on Brexit. The Supreme Court said UK ministers were ""not legally compelled"" to consult the assembly and that AMs have no veto. Mr Antoniw said it is likely AMs would get a vote on the triggering process. But he said it will not be a veto on leaving the EU. AMs could decide to hold a vote in the assembly on article 50 if they feel that the legislation on article 50 affects devolution. There is a convention - called the Sewel Convention - whereby the assembly has a say on legislation in Westminster that affects devolution in the form of a vote in the chamber. But Tuesday's ruling that AMs do not have a veto on Brexit means that whether or not the vote has meaning will depend on the UK government's reaction. Mr Antoniw told AMs on Tuesday: ""As the Article 50 Bill proceeds through Parliament, we would expect the UK government to respect the Sewel Convention, so that Parliament has the opportunity to listen to the assembly and to the other devolved legislatures."" Mr Antoniw said there was ""every likelihood of a vote (in the assembly) because a trigger bill will impact on Welsh legislation"". The court ruled Theresa May cannot trigger Article 50 - the formal exit process from the EU - without the backing of MPs and peers. The court also said UK ministers were ""not legally compelled"" to consult the devolved legislatures in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Analysis by BBC Wales political correspondent Daniel Davies It sounds like the eleven Supreme Court judges sent the Welsh Government packing. They all agree: there's no legal reason for Theresa May to consult the assembly. But there is a political reason for Parliament to listen. And if Parliament must vote on Brexit, it leaves the door ajar for the assembly to influence things. That means there might be a vote in the assembly on triggering Article 50, as well as in Westminster. I am also sorry to disappoint anyone who hopes that a vote in Cardiff Bay could stop Brexit. It will not. All sides agree the assembly does not have a power of veto.","Mr Antoniw said it is likely AMs would get a vote on the triggering process. But he said it will not be a veto on leaving the EU. AMs could decide to hold a vote in the assembly on article 50 if they feel that the legislation on article 50 affects devolution. But Tuesday's ruling that AMs do not have a veto on Brexit means that whether or not the vote has meaning will depend on the UK government's reaction. Mr Antoniw said there was ""every likelihood of a vote (in the assembly) because a trigger bill will impact on Welsh legislation"". The court also said UK ministers were ""not legally compelled"" to consult the devolved legislatures in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

198,36182796,"It was President Hassan Rouhani's first reaction to the results of Friday's run-off election, in which moderates and reformists won a working majority. The 17 women elected make up 6% of the new cohort of 290 MPs. Only 16 cleric MPs have been voted in, meaning the new parliament will include more women than religious leaders. President Rouhani acknowledged the new record and said: ""People chose the best candidates in the 26 February and 29 April elections."" The BBC's Kasra Naji says the results signal ""a major shift in public support away from hardline Islamic conservatives"". Friday's run-off election was held in constituencies where no candidate had won the minimum proportion of the vote in a first round in February. Four women were elected in the run-off, joining other women who had been voted in already. The outgoing parliament includes nine female representatives. Friday's vote gives women in Iran the same share of seats as in countries including Thailand and Nigeria. Why Iran's moderates must capitalise quickly An 18th woman was elected but her votes have been annulled by the Guardian Council, a constitutional oversight body. No reasons were given for excluding Minu Khaleqi after the first round. President Rouhani lent support to her in his speech on Sunday when he told an audience ""18 female legislators"" had been voted in. The election of a record number of women is a sign of a major shift in public support away from hard-line Islamic conservatives who have taken only 26% of seats - a dismal performance. This shift is also apparent in the fact that almost all hardline clerics lost their seats. The number of clerics in parliament in Iran has steadily declined over the years from 164 in the first parliament just after the Islamic revolution in 1979. Islamic hardliners see the declining number of clerics elected as a threat to the Islamic revolution and have called on more clerics to come forward and enter politics - at a time when many ordinary people are turning away from the religious leaders. The elections have now ended the 12 year dominance of the Islamic hardliners over parliament.

199,32145849,"Sexist, racist and homophobic remarks were being used by pupils against school staff, as well as offensive comments about appearance, the NASUWT said. There were also examples of parents being abusive on social media, it added. About 60% of 1,500 teachers questioned in a poll said they had faced abuse, compared with 21% last year. In one case, a photograph of a teacher was posted online with an insulting word underneath. In another, pupils used the name of a heavily pregnant school worker to post insults, the teachers' union said. Of those who had been subjected to insults, nearly half (48%) said these remarks were posted by pupils, 40% said they were put up by parents, and 12% said both parents and pupils were responsible. Almost two-thirds (62%) said pupils had posted insulting comments, while just over a third (34%) said students had taken photos or videos without consent. A third (33%) received remarks about their performance as a teacher, 9% had faced allegations from pupils about inappropriate behaviour and 8% had been subjected to threatening behaviour. More than half (57%) of pupils responsible were aged between 14 and 16, and 38% were 11 to 14, the teachers' poll found, with a fifth aged 16 to 19 and 5% were seven to 11. Among the examples published by NASUWT was the case of a student uploading a teacher's photo and then, along with classmates, writing insults underneath. One teacher had been harassed for nine months by students who sent sexually explicit messages and set up a fake social media account in the teacher's name. The union said it had been told of a teacher receiving the comment ""I hope she gets cancer"", while the heavily pregnant worker had faced abusive remarks. Another school worker faced comments from a pupil's family member about how they looked and that they were ugly. Chris Keates, the union's general secretary, said: ""It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. ""Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse.

And how reliable are they? Local elections have been held in North Korea since 1999 - let's not forget that the country's full name is, technically, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Sunday's elections are to decide provincial governors, mayors and local assemblies in the country of almost 25m people. The number of seats is determined by each district's population. In the second provincial elections in 2003, one report said 26,650 ""officials, workers, peasants and intellectuals"" were elected. The choice is limited - there is only one candidate on the ballot in each district, and while the selection of candidates is made by the governing coalition, they are closely overseen by Kim Jong-un's Workers' Party. Ahead of last year's elections to name deputies for the country's assembly, The Economist reported that voting did not take place in secret, and any dissenting votes must be placed in a separate ballot box. Abstaining or voting no are considered acts of treason. In the last local election, in 2011, there was a turnout of 99.7%, with the state news agency saying those unable to vote were abroad or on the high seas. Having such a high reported turnout has its advantages for the state, observers say, in that it acts as an informal census.

Last week, Chinese and Vietnamese ships clashed over the drilling rig that China has placed in waters near the disputed Paracel Islands. China and Manila are also at odds over overlapping territorial claims. Beijing claims a U-shaped swathe of the South China Sea that covers areas other South East Asian nations say are their territory. The issue has been rumbling in recent years amid an increasingly assertive stance from China over its claims. Last week, several collisions were reported between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in disputed waters as the Vietnamese ships sought to prevent the installation of the Chinese drilling rig. Reports suggest the stand-off - involving dozens of ships - is continuing, with water cannon fire being exchanged. On Sunday, anti-China protests took place in several Vietnamese cities. It is the most serious confrontation between the two nations for several years. In Monday's telephone call, Mr Kerry ""said China's introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was provocative"", US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""He urged both sides to de-escalate tensions, ensure safe conduct by their vessels at sea, and resolve the dispute through peaceful means in accordance with international law."" Separately, in comments made at a meeting with the Singaporean foreign minister, Mr Kerry called the Chinese move an ""aggressive act"". Mr Wang, meanwhile, urged Mr Kerry to be objective on the issue, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said. Tensions between Beijing and Manila are also running high, after the Philippines arrested and then charged nine Chinese fishermen with poaching at a disputed shoal. The Philippines is in the process of taking China to a UN court over its territorial claims. It has also recently signed a new security deal with the US which would allow an expanded US troop presence, in a move seen as linked to Manila's deteriorating ties with Beijing. On Tuesday, Chinese state media slammed the Philippines, saying that if it continued to challenge China it would pay ""an unaffordable price"".","China and Manila are also at odds over overlapping territorial claims.

In Monday's telephone call, Mr Kerry ""said China's introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was provocative"", US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""He urged both sides to de-escalate tensions, ensure safe conduct by their vessels at sea, and resolve the dispute through peaceful means in accordance with international law."" Tensions between Beijing and Manila are also running high, after the Philippines arrested and then charged nine Chinese fishermen with poaching at a disputed shoal. It has also recently signed a new security deal with the US which would allow an expanded US troop presence, in a move seen as linked to Manila's deteriorating ties with Beijing.","The US has warned China that moving a drilling rig into seas disputed with Vietnam was ""provocative"".",490,242

The business support agency, Invest NI, has also said it will work with the company and others to help the staff. Workers have been given time off after Tuesday's announcement and are due back in the factory on Thursday. The Ballymena factory has been in operation since 1969 and is a major employer in the area. Staff, union representatives and politicians have described the planned run-down of the plant as ""devastating"". David Thompson from the union, Unite, said he was still waiting to hear from the Enterprise Minister, Jonathan Bell, after meeting him in July in relation to concerns around the future of the plant. In response, Mr Bell said: ""I've been speaking with people that are badly affected and what they're telling me is they're not interested in 'he said, she said' nonsense. ""I accept what David has said, it was a generalised meeting, we both accepted there is a major problem here, and we both accept that nothing we could have done from that meeting in July would have saved the Michelin plant. I want to meet with David, I want to meet with Unite, I want to meet with them constructively."" Stephen Kelly, from Manufacturing Northern Ireland, said the main factor for the closure is energy costs. He said it was time for the executive to commit to a manufacturing strategy. ""Michelin made it really clear, the local management have not been behind the door in telling our local assembly and others that the energy issue was something that was hurting them enormously and what we've seen yesterday, unfortunately, is too little and too late, for Michelin to secure that plant for the next 20 years,"" he said. Speaking in the Commons, Prime Minister David Cameron said companies deemed to be energy intensive should qualify for reductions in power bills due to his policies. He was responding to a question from the DUP MP Nigel Dodds about the role energy prices played in the closure of the Michelin plant. Mr Cameron also reminded MPs that legislation had been passed to enable Northern Ireland to set its own rate of corporation tax and that the sooner there was a political deal the sooner action could be taken to build a stronger private sector.","Workers have been given time off after Tuesday's announcement and are due back in the factory on Thursday.

210,34118105,"In Catholicism, abortion is viewed as such a grave sin that it warrants automatic excommunication. In most countries, only a bishop can approve forgiveness for abortion. They would then delegate an expert priest to hear the confession. The change is only for the coming Jubilee Year, beginning in December. However, the rule relaxation will not affect Catholics in England, Wales and Scotland as all priests there can already forgive abortion without seeking permission from a bishop. The Pope said many women who sought an abortion did so because they ""believe that they have no other option"". He added that he had ""met so many women who bear in their heart the scar of this agonising and painful decision"". The easing of the rules is being seen as a shift in Catholic Church policy, reflecting the Pope's outspoken views on compassion and mercy. ""'I have decided, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to allow all priests for the Jubilee Year to absolve of the sin of abortion those who procure it and who also seek forgiveness,"" Pope Francis said. Pope Francis is aware that the decision will not be welcomed by traditionalists, says the BBC's David Willey. However, in contrast to his predecessors, he regards compassion and mercy as virtues that outclass all others. The Jubilee Year runs from 8 December 2015 to 26 November 2016 and is seen as one of the Catholic Church's most important events. It normally takes place every 25 years unless a pope declares an extraordinary one to draw attention to a particular issue. The Pope has previously denounced abortion as part of a throw-away culture. ""It is horrific even to think that there are children, victims of abortion, who will never see the light of day,"" he said in 2014. ""Unfortunately, what is thrown away is not only food and dispensable objects, but often human beings themselves, who are discarded as unnecessary,"" he added. Pope Francis has been viewed as progressive on other controversial issues. In 2013, on the topic of homosexuality, he said: ""Who am I to judge?"" However, he has not changed Church policy on contraception. Speaking earlier this year, Pope Francis said that although contraception remains forbidden, there was no need for people to breed ""like rabbits"" to be good Catholics.","In Catholicism, abortion is viewed as such a grave sin that it warrants automatic excommunication.

The Voyager aircraft, which had 198 passengers and crew on board, plummeted 4,400ft (1,341m) over the Black Sea. Townshend pleaded guilty to negligently performing a duty and was also handed a four-month suspended prison sentence. The court martial heard that during a flight from RAF Brize Norton to Afghanistan on 9 February 2014 the 49-year-old pilot's camera was pushed into the aircraft's control stick as he moved his seat, switching off the autopilot. A board of RAF officers at Bulford, Wiltshire, heard crew and passengers thought they were going to die during the flight, and some were thrown weightless into the air and smashed into the ceiling. Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, said the incident led to the grounding of the military fleet of six Voyager aircraft for 13 days while the cause of the nosedive was investigated. This led to service personnel being stranded in Afghanistan while they waited for the aircraft to be brought back into service, he added. He said up to 48 personnel were left unfit for duty and the co-pilot, Flt Lt Nathan Jones, who suffered fractures to his spine, is still unable to resume flying duties. Mr Lickley said: ""Their lives and health and welfare were put at significant risk by Flt Lt Townshend's negligence."" The experienced pilot - who has served with the RAF for 30 years and completed 5,500 flying hours - had been using his camera to photograph other aircraft from the cockpit and had taken 95 shots that day. He also told the court that he had been viewing the star-filled sky moments before the incident, as he had a passion for star-gazing. Judge Advocate Alan Large told Townshend: ""This was not a momentary lapse of concentration, your eye was well off the ball."" On Wednesdy, Townshend was found not guilty of perjury and making a false record, after being accused of dishonestly claiming the dive was caused by a technical fault.","A board of RAF officers at Bulford, Wiltshire, heard crew and passengers thought they were going to die during the flight, and some were thrown weightless into the air and smashed into the ceiling.

The family have denied that she was suicidal and have accused the jail of being ""reckless"" in disregarding her safety and failing to keep her free from harm. The Waller County grand jury would return in January to consider whether to indict police officer Brian Encinia, who arrested Ms Bland in July, prosecutor Darrell Jordan said. A video of the arrest shows Mr Encinia giving Ms Bland a warning. The situation quickly escalates, with Mr Encinia appearing to threaten Ms Bland after she refuses to get out of her car. He unsuccessfully tries to pull her out and tells her ""I will light you up"". Ms Bland's family has alleged Mr Encinia falsified an assault allegation to take her into custody. An attorney representing Ms Bland's family, Cannon Lambert, said on Monday that the grand jury's decision was consistent with what the family believed was an attempt by authorities to cover up the events surrounding Ms Bland's death. ""They continue to do things we are disappointed in,"" he said. Ms Bland's sister Shante Needham has said Sandra had called her from jail, saying she did not know why she had been arrested and that an officer had possibly broken her arm. Ms Bland died by asphyxiation after using a plastic bag to hang herself in her cell, according to Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathias. Video footage from the jail did not show what happened inside Ms Bland's cell, but did suggest no-one entered or left it until someone found her unconscious. Mr Mathis has said there is nothing in that investigation ""that shows anything happened but she killed herself"".","The jury ruled that neither sheriff's officials nor jailers committed a crime in their treatment of Bland. It has not yet been determined whether the police officer who arrested her should face charges, a prosecutor said. Police say that Ms Bland hanged herself while being held in the Waller County jail.

219,34181122,"Didn't MPs vote against bombing Syria a couple of years ago? In the last few days haven't the prime minister and the chancellor made clear they would only take military action in Syria if there was a consensus here in the UK? In any case, isn't it entirely unusual, almost unheard of in modern times, for British military action to take the life of a British citizen? The answer to all three of those questions is yes. But just a couple of weeks ago, an unmanned British Reaper drone did drop a missile on a group of so-called IS fighters in Syria that killed two British citizens. One, the target, Reyaad Khan, was according to David Cameron involved in plotting a barbaric attack on British soil. In the PM's view and, he says, the view of the government's most senior lawyer - the attorney general - that made the attack entirely proper and legal. ""There was a terrorist directing murder on our streets and no other means to stop him,"" the PM said. Although we've been told repeatedly British drones have been flying over Syria to carry out surveillance, in the small print the government always retained the right to act in extremis without specific permission from MPs. For Number 10, that action is distinct from its decision on whether to take military action and have RAF pilots join US forces flying bombing missions over Syria. The prime minister still wants to persuade MPs to back that plan this autumn, although a vote is unlikely until after the party conference season wraps up. But this strike does add a sense of urgency to those making the arguments for intervention - a reminder that so-called IS plan and plot in Syria, that the direct threat to the UK is real and getting more serious. But there are calls tonight from opposition politicians for more information and reassurance on the particular circumstances around this attack, accusations already that the strike is evidence of British ""mission creep"". As the operation appears to have been led by intelligence the truth is we may never know what really happened, what the precise circumstances were. But the fact that we know a British plane has dropped a British bomb in Syria, on British citizens may mean, earlier than expected, the battle lines in this debate are drawn.","Didn't MPs vote against bombing Syria a couple of years ago?

220,39577369,"Combined takings from streaming, downloads, physical sales and licensing for use in films, TV and computer games rose 5.1% to £926m. The main contributor to growth was streaming, but vinyl revenues rose by more than two thirds. However, more revenues could be generated by platforms such as Youtube, the BPI said. Revenue from physical formats dipped below £300m last year, but remained just above the £274m generated by streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer. Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the Brit Awards, said the increase in revenues was encouraging, as more and more consumers enjoyed the benefits of subscribing to a streaming service or rediscovered the joys of vinyl. ""Britain's world-leading music sector has the potential for sustained growth in the years ahead, but this exciting future can only be realised if government makes creative businesses a priority post-Brexit,"" he added. UK artists needed to be able to tour freely in EU markets, and UK businesses needed to be able to employ the best talent, Mr Taylor argued. He added that strong intellectual property protections would need to be included in trade talks with third party countries. An International Trade spokeswoman said: ""Music is one of our most important exports and trade policy has a key role in supporting growth in this market. ""We will in due course explore all options in the design of future trade agreements, including the role of intellectual property rights in boosting UK exports in overseas markets."" Streaming revenues jumped more than 60% in 2016, and accounted for close to a third of label revenues. The BPI said streaming would overtake revenues from physical sales in 2017. However, the association added that there was a ""growing mismatch between the huge value that certain digital platforms, such as YouTube, extract from music or other entertainment and the relatively small amount they return back to the creators concerned"". A YouTube spokesperson said it was working ""with the music industry to bring more money to artists, labels and publishers"". She said that YouTube had paid out more than $1bn to the music industry globally from advertising in the past year. ""YouTube is contributing a meaningful and growing revenue stream for the industry."" However, many argue that the Google-owned video site should pay out far more revenue to artists and songwriters.","The main contributor to growth was streaming, but vinyl revenues rose by more than two thirds.

221,17337318,"Katharine of Aragon died at Kimbolton Castle in 1536, and was buried at the cathedral following a lavish funeral. A festival marks the anniversary of her death and a Catholic mass is celebrated - a rarity in an Anglican cathedral. This is one of a number of unusual stories to be told in the BBC's People's Passion, which explores the purpose of cathedrals today. Katharine was cast aside by Henry VIII for being unable to provide the Tudor dynasty with a male heir. Stuart Orme, from Vivacity Heritage which co-organises the Katharine of Aragon Festival, said: ""She was revered for her piety and dignity. ""Many of the population had a good deal of sympathy for Katharine after the divorce and felt she had been hard done by."" Despite living in reduced circumstances after the end of her marriage, she was given an elaborate funeral on 29 January 1536, involving four bishops and six abbots. Her tomb was of black marble, with gilded letters and decoration. Mr Orme said: ""But Oliver Cromwell's soldiers stole the gilding during the sack of the cathedral in 1643, while a dean of the cathedral used the marble for the floor of his summerhouse in the 1700s."" It was not until the late 19th Century that a wife of one of the cathedral canons, Katharine Clayton, started a public appeal asking all the Katharines of England to donate to the replacement marble slab which can be seen today. The cathedral now marks the funeral date with the Katharine of Aragon Festival on the Friday and Saturday nearest the 29 January. A representative of the Spanish embassy is invited to a civic service on the Friday and a Catholic mass is held on the Saturday. Hundreds of children are encouraged to dress in Tudor costume, and learn how people lived in the early 16th Century from historic re-enactors. Flowers, and Katharine's heraldic symbol, the pomegranate, are laid upon her tomb. She had chosen the fruit when she was still a princess in Spain because to the medieval world it symbolised fertility.","Katharine was cast aside by Henry VIII for being unable to provide the Tudor dynasty with a male heir.

222,30260834,"IS militants launched at least four suicide attacks, with reports saying at least 25 people were killed. The first of the attacks was near the Turkish border crossing. It is thought to be the first fighting in that area. The battle for Kobane has left hundreds of people dead and forced more than 200,000 to flee into Turkey. The US-led coalition is supporting the town's defenders with air strikes. Turkey has allowed some Kurdish fighters from Iraq to travel through its territory to assist in defending Kobane. However, Turkey views Kurdish forces with suspicion, following a decade-long battle for autonomy by its own Kurdish minority. IS controls large swathes of both Syria and neighbouring Iraq. The militants have been trying to overrun Kobane for the past two months. In the early stages, it looked as though the town's fall was only a matter of time. But the Kurdish fighters have defended tenaciously and kept hold of roughly half the town. They have been supported by a small number of well-armed Iraqi Kurdish fighters, some other Syrian opposition units, and of course by the coalition air strikes. The first suicide vehicle bomb targeted a Kurdish position close to the Turkish border at dawn on Saturday. Kurdish sources said the bomber had crossed from Turkey, but Turkish officials denied this as ""lies"". Clashes followed at the site of the attack and to the south-west of the town. The UK-based activist group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said there were three more suicide bombings - one an individual with a suicide vest and the other two vehicle bombs. As the clashes intensified, there were reports that IS had brought up tanks to join the fighting. Meanwhile two US-led air strikes were carried out against IS positions in the east of Kobane. In all, 25 people were killed in the clashes, most of them IS fighters, reports said. IS has captured parts of the town and dozens of villages in the area around it in an offensive lasting more than two months. But it has met stiff resistance from local Kurdish fighters, who have held about half the town assisted by small numbers of Iraqi Kurds and Syrian Arabs, and backed by US-led air strikes.","It is thought to be the first fighting in that area.

Mysterious pictures online of a clown and a balaclava-wearing sidekick have caused a stir in the town.

224,33157374,"The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said it was difficult to keep the vessel Millennium Time on a steady heading before it struck a tug on the River Thames in July 2014. The report also said the man at the helm at the time of the crash did not hold a boatmaster's licence. City Cruises apologised and said passenger safety was ""paramount"". The nine injured passengers suffered cuts and bruises when the boat struck motor tug Redoubt, which was towing three barges between Blackfriars and Waterloo bridges on the Thames on 17 July 2014. The 69-year-old mate's employment as a helmsman was contrary to the instructions of the Millennium Time's operators, City Cruises, the report said. And the 58-year-old master of vessel was providing a sightseeing commentary, meaning he did not supervise the mate at the helm, the report concluded. The MAIB said the mate did not take immediate action to avoid the vessel's collision with Redoubt because he thought the motor tug was turning towards Millennium Time, but Millennium Time had unexpectedly steered towards the motor tug. The report said: ""The turn was not deliberately initiated by the movement of the helm and most likely resulted from the unintended application of port rudder, and/or the influence of the effects of (an aquatic phenomenon known as) hydrodynamic interaction."" By the time the helmsman noticed the vessel was turning the collision could not be prevented, the MAIB said. The report added the crew were also unaware of the number of passengers onboard - they thought they were carrying 426 people but the police counted 362. Both vessels were damaged and it took 32 days to repair Millennium Time's damage, which included broken windows. The MAIB, which made a number of safety recommendations, said City Cruises had replaced the steering systems on Millennium Time and its sister vessels. In a statement, City Cruises said its vessels undergo rigorous testing and the helmsman was in the process of completing his boatmaster's licence. Spokesman Kyle Haughton said: ""The safety of our passengers and crew is paramount to us.

One boy had been trying to pass Joyce in a narrow aisle and after an exchange of words was knocked to the floor. Joyce will be sentenced at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 27 May.

The attack happened close to the drinks fridge at about 21:40 BST on 17 October and was filmed on the store's CCTV. Joyce ""flung"" the 14-year-old boy to the floor and held him down by the throat, the court heard. ""He started shouting in my face. I remember begging him to leave me alone,"" the boy said. His 15-year-old friend was elbowed and winded while trying to help and both boys then fled the shop, the court was told. Shopkeeper Ali Fahan said: ""I told the man to let him go because he was crying."" Giving evidence, Joyce insisted he had overcome his battle with alcohol after a string of previous convictions. The court heard that he assaulted politicians in the House of Commons bar in 2012, which led to his resignation from the Labour Party. He said: ""I have a background as a judo player. I was conscious I didn't want to over-act."" The former army major told the court he felt threatened when the boys walked by because one was shouting and swearing and had taken an ""aggressive"" stance. Joyce said he put his hand out to stop the teenager knocking over a supermarket shelf but it fell anyway. Delivering his verdict, District Judge John Zani said: ""In my view, you underplayed the violence you meted out to these young men and wanted the police called so as to justify your actions.

229,36828072,"In 2015, there were 412 district nurses in Wales, down 42% from 712 in 2009, figures have shown. The Royal College of Nursing said it was placing pressure on GP surgeries and emergency departments. The Welsh Government said overall, the total number of nurses providing community services had increased. District nurses are senior, experienced nurses sometimes compared to being the GPs of nursing and clinically supervise less experienced staff or those with fewer qualifications, such as health care workers. The Welsh Government figures showed that in six of the seven health boards in Wales, the number of district nurses has fallen between 2009 and 2015. Only staffing at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board remained at the same level it was six years ago. The RCN said it wanted more information gathered about outcomes for people being nursed at home instead of in hospital. It said it was concerned the move to look after more people at home could have affected the care people receive. In hospitals, outcomes are measured - such as with waiting lists - but there are less ways to judge nursing care received at home, it added. Tina Donnelly, director of the RCN in Wales, said it has ""undoubtedly"" contributed to to GP waiting times and possibly re-admissions to hospitals, as more care is given in the community. She also claimed district nurses have seen a big increase in their caseloads over the past few years, from around 30 patients to 150. ""That beggars belief in terms of the absolute contact time that nurse will be able to spend with that patient,"" she said. A Welsh Government spokesman said while the number of district nurses had fallen, the overall number of nurses providing community services had increased by 17% over the past six years, from 3,338 full time equivalent community nursing staff in 2009 to 3,915 in 2015. ""This is largely because health boards are keen to develop a more effective skills mix at local level, using highly experienced district nurses to direct, lead and advise community nursing teams,"" he said. ""With regards to outcomes for patients, the recently launched NHS Outcomes and Delivery Framework 2016-17 - which was developed through engagement with patients, clinicians and stakeholders - identifies key outcomes and priority areas the NHS must be measured against. ""The framework has been balanced to ensure that all aspects of care are represented, including care provided in the community.""","The Royal College of Nursing said it was placing pressure on GP surgeries and emergency departments.

230,25744060,"But potentially that is just the tip of the iceberg. Over the past decade or so pharmacists have been given more and more responsibilities in the NHS, just as nurses have. It means many now offer blood pressure checks, and cholesterol and blood glucose level tests alongside pregnancy testing and sexually transmitted infection services. Colds and flu can often be dealt with there, without bothering a GP at all, while some even provide stop smoking services and prescribe drugs and treatments. But despite their expanding remit, much of the public is oblivious. Less than a third of people asked in a recent YouGov poll of over 2,000 people were aware of what pharmacists could offer. So now Pharmacy Voice, which represents the industry, is launching a drive to change perceptions. It is running a two-year promotional campaign, Dispensing Health, to promote what the UK's 13,000 community pharmacies can do. ""Pharmacy is the third largest health profession (in the health sector) after medicine and nursing,"" says Pharmacy Voice chief executive Prof Robert Darracott. ""Yet people still don't really know who we are and what we can do."" He says the aim of the campaign is to ""challenge the traditional view of pharmacies as simply dispensers of medicine"" so that they are seen as a place where illness can be treated and good health promoted. The push has received the backing of GPs with both the Royal College of GPs and NHS Alliance, which represents community services, putting their names to the campaign. Making sure the potential of pharmacies is realised could also have important implications for the rest of the health service too. A review by NHS England into the A&E system, which was published in November, said pharmacies were an ""under-used"" resource that if tapped into could take the pressure off GPs who in turn would then have time to take on some of the workload of hospitals. Dr Mike Dixon, of the NHS Alliance, says: ""Community pharmacy is perfectly positioned to take the strain from GPs and A&E departments that are bursting at the seams."" It is thought as many as one in seven GP appointments could be dealt with by pharmacies - about 40m a year.

But there were still more children arriving than could be taught, he warned. There had been financial support from the international community - and more had been pledged, Mr Thneibat said - but almost two-thirds of the cost of each extra refugee pupil was being taken from Jordan's own education budget, he said.

232,35495879,"Roger Caffrey, 70, was found guilty of three counts of rape and 12 counts of indecent assault in Nottinghamshire from 1978 to 1994. One ex-pupil was raped six times by Caffrey at his home during a ""campaign of rape"", Nottingham Crown Court heard. A number of offences against his seven victims took place during lesson time. Caffrey was cleared of two charges of indecent assault following a three-week trial. Police began investigating him after a victim, who said she was raped when she was nine years old, contacted officers in December 2012. Nottinghamshire Police said all but one of the offences took place when Caffrey was deputy head teacher at Northgate Primary School in Nottingham - now the Djanogly Northgate Academy - from 1978 to 1984.

Pupils ""no older than 11 years of age"" were touched while they read aloud in class, or when they were in a store cupboard in the classroom, the court heard. Two victims were raped at Caffrey's home. One of the rape victims went to the police 22 years ago but no charges were brought due to a lack of evidence, the court heard. She was contacted in 2013 following the start of the investigation into Caffrey, but the original documents into the 1994 case had been lost.

235,32118803,"Samples drilled from beneath the Indian Ocean are being used to reconstruct past rainfall and temperature records. Scientists are studying how the Indian monsoon behaved in the past, to shed light on the impact of climate change. The research will lead to a better understanding of how the monsoon over India might change, said Dr Kate Littler of the University of Exeter. As part of the larger-scale Asian monsoon, the monsoon over India is formed due to intense heat from the Sun in late spring, which warms the Northern Indian Ocean, along with the plains of northern India and the Tibetan Plateau. This results in 75% of the year's rain falling between June and September. Simulations of future climate generally suggest a 5-10% increase in monsoon rainfall over India, which could influence the economy and agriculture. Palaeoclimatology - the study of changes in climate taken on the scale of the entire history of Earth - can give valuable clues to how the Earth might respond to future climate change. Dr Littler was part of an expedition to the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea on a scientific drill ship belonging to the UK International Ocean Discovery Program. The team of international scientists collected sediment samples from the deep-sea at several locations. These are being analysed to reconstruct what the regional and global climate was like during the period when the small fossilised marine creatures contained in the sediments lived. ""We wanted to capture the whole evolution of the India monsoon from when it intensified about 8 million years ago,"" said Dr Littler. ""By analysing these hard-to-reach deep-sea sediments we will make important discoveries about the behaviour of the Indian monsoon in the deep past, and how its behaviour and intensity may change in the near future. ""The data will give us a holistic idea of the past behaviour of the monsoon."" Some of the samples came from sites that had never been drilled before. Others contained volcanic ashes, which can be matched to ancient volcanic eruptions, helping in dating the sediments. Their chemistry, geology and biology will be analysed to build up a record of how the annual Indian monsoon cycle has historically been affected by climate change.","Samples drilled from beneath the Indian Ocean are being used to reconstruct past rainfall and temperature records.

236,39251585,"Some Australian states already have ""no jab, no play"" laws, but PM Malcolm Turnbull is calling for nationwide legislation. Health groups have supported the push, arguing parents and the community have an obligation to protect children. An Australian Child Health Poll survey of nearly 2,000 parents showed 5% of children were not fully vaccinated. Mr Turnbull said more needed to be done, citing the case of a baby who died from whooping cough. ""This is not a theoretical exercise - this is life and death,"" Mr Turnbull said. ""If a parent says, 'I'm not going to vaccinate my child,' they are not simply putting their child at risk, they are putting everybody else's children at risk too."" Vaccinating children is not a legal requirement in Australia, but failing to do so makes parents ineligible for childcare rebates. Three Australian states - Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria - already require children to be immunised, or be on an approved catch-up programme, to enrol in childcare centres. Australian Medical Association president Michael Gannon said children were more susceptible to infections. ""If you, as a parent, expect the community to support you by either welfare payments or access to care, then you need to do your bit to contribute to that community by protecting other children,"" he told Fairfax Media. The so-called ""anti-vax"" movement believes vaccinations may cause medical conditions such as autism, but overwhelming scientific research suggests this is not the case. Vaccines can cause adverse reactions in a small number of people, like many medicines, but the accepted science is that the benefits far outweigh the risks. Widespread vaccination also reduces the risk of infection to those who, for medical reasons, may not be able to receive the vaccine themselves. So-called ""herd immunity"" is an important part of public health programmes. It stops the spread of disease by preventing an infection from moving among most people - the ones who have been vaccinated. And so it protects those few without the vaccine. But as the numbers of those without protection rises, so to does the risk to each of them - something which happened alongside the first death from measles in the United States in 12 years.","Mr Turnbull said more needed to be done, citing the case of a baby who died from whooping cough.

The two murderers escaped three weeks ago from the maximum security Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora through the sewer system after using power tools to break out of their cell. The spectacular escape set off a massive manhunt. Sweat was shot and seized in the town of Constable on Sunday, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference. He said Sweat was shot twice in the torso and was now in hospital in stable condition. The convict was spotted by a police officer on patrol and shot when he tried to run away.

Matt was shot dead near the town of Malone. The pair had been making their way through rugged forests in upstate New York, stealing food and guns from woodland cabins along the way. US officials have charged prison worker Joyce Mitchell with aiding the two inmates in their escape. Prosecutors allege that she gave the men power tools that allowed them to saw through a steel cell wall before bashing a hole through a brick wall and crawling through. Ms Mitchell denies the charges. Clinton correction officer Gene Palmer is also accused of aiding the convicts.

""The detainees are travelling on a charter flight accompanied by security officers.

Mr Dutton told the ABC that the asylum seekers held at the compound with the convicted criminals - including the New Zealand nationals - were only sent there after risk assessments.

""This is the community that helped build us to what we are,"" vice-president Ashley Chapman told the BBC. Although regulations and an asbestos problem might make buying the school difficult, he said the company will work with the school board to come up with a solution that works, and intends to help cover some costs. ""Somebody's got to step to the plate and somebody's got to help fix the situation,"" he said. Mr Chapman proposed buying the building and leasing it back to the school board at a reasonable rate in order to keep the school open. But the aging building could require millions of dollars worth of repairs, and regulations make it tricky for a private company to buy a public building still intended for public use. ""Essentially what we were proposing was a giant band aid to delay the situation,"" he said. The school is one of about 600 - many in rural areas - that the province has earmarked to be shut down in order to save costs. If Beavercrest were to close, children from the town would have to spend up to 90 minutes in a bus commuting to one of three other schools in the area. It has 195 students but has a capacity for 319, according to a recent report by the local school board.

Chapman's, which was founded in 1973 by his parents, is one of the largest ice cream manufacturers in Canada and has doubled its workforce over the past six years, he said.

It comes ahead of the publication of a UN inquiry into possible war crimes committed during the war, a report Israel dismissed as a waste of time. The 50-day conflict between Israel and Gaza militants, lasted from July to late August 2014. It left at least 2,189 Palestinians dead, including more than 1,486 civilians, according to the UN. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers were killed along with six civilians. The 277-page report, released by the Israeli foreign ministry, disputed the UN figures, estimating that 2,125 Palestinians had been killed, including 936 militants and 761 civilians, with the status of the remaining casualties unknown. It said that Hamas militants disguised themselves as civilians and converted civilian buildings into military centres. ""This exploitation of civilian surroundings - which often constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity - posed significant operational, legal and ethical challenges for the IDF,"" the report said. ""Harm to the civilian population... occurred as the result of unfortunate - yet lawful - incidental effects of legitimate military action in the vicinity of civilians and their surroundings,"" it added.

247,37743433,"The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said the area used to farm the poppy plant, the source of opium, increased by 10% to 201,000 hectares. But better farming conditions resulted in a higher yield per hectare, increasing overall production. Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of the substance, which is the main ingredient in heroin. Growing opium is a crime in the country, but it is still a major cash crop for impoverished farming communities. The Taliban also taxes poppy production in areas it controls, which is a major source of income for its military activities. UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov said the figures were ""a worrying reversal in efforts"". The opium produced from the poppy plant is used to make some of the most powerful medicinal painkillers, such as morphine. However, many nations cultivate their own supply for medicinal use, and Afghanistan's production of illicit opium is primarily sued for the illegal drug trade. The Afghan government has a stated policy of eradicating poppy crops, but the crop is widespread in many government-controlled regions, and officials are often accused of turning a blind eye. Earlier this year, the BBC's South Asia correspondent Justin Rowlatt visited poppy farms in the north-east, where one farmer told him the local government knew about his crop, but ""they also know it is the only way anyone can make decent money."" Just 355 hectares (877 acres) of poppies were eradicated by provincial authorities in the last year - down more than 90% since 2015, when almost 4,000 hectares were cleared. Seven insurgents and one officer died during attacks on eradication teams this year. Seven more people were injured. The southern region of the country is the most productive area, accounting for 54% of the entire national opium production. Helmand province, which has seen a resurgent Taliban presence, is the single largest producer, with more than 80,000 hectares of poppy cultivation. The region was a contested area between the Taliban and Nato-led forces, before the latter withdrew in 2014. Taliban militants launched a fresh assault on the Helmand regional capital of Lashkar Gah in early October.","But better farming conditions resulted in a higher yield per hectare, increasing overall production.

The head of Amisom told the BBC the correct papers to account for the last tranche had now been submitted. ""These papers are on their way; the money is also on its way,"" Francisco Madeira said. The EU provides $1,028 (Â£700) for each Amisom soldier each month; their respective governments then deduct around $200 for administrative costs meaning the soldiers are supposed to take home about $800. This deployment allowance is much more than the meagre salaries the soldiers receive from their governments. The funds are only released to Amisom by the EU once the accounts from the previous payment are signed off. The BBC understands there have been delays over the last two tranches - and last year's June-November payment has only just arrived. So soldiers are now receiving money owed to them last year but have not received any of it owed to them this year. Ugandan military chief General Katumba Wamala said he unable to describe the extent of his frustration over the late payments. Gen Wamala also said that Uganda would pull its soldiers out of Somalia by December 2017, because of frustrations with the Somali army and military advisers from the US, UK and Turkey. Uganda joined Amisom in 2007 and is the force's biggest contributor, with more than 6,000 troops. Burundian military officials also said their troops had not been paid.

Kenya has never confirmed how many soldiers it lost in the attack and African Union does not release full casualty figures.","An European Union source told the BBC that last six-month payment was being withheld over ""accounting issues"". The EU provides $1,028 (Â£700) for each Amisom soldier each month; their respective governments then deduct around $200 for administrative costs meaning the soldiers are supposed to take home about $800. So soldiers are now receiving money owed to them last year but have not received any of it owed to them this year. Gen Wamala also said that Uganda would pull its soldiers out of Somalia by December 2017, because of frustrations with the Somali army and military advisers from the US, UK and Turkey. Uganda joined Amisom in 2007 and is the force's biggest contributor, with more than 6,000 troops. Burundian military officials also said their troops had not been paid. Amisom officials fear that the late payments are having a negative impact have on troop morale.

The Health and Social Care Board has said new guidelines are in place and add that no children have gone missing since 2014. Separated children are children outside their country of origin and separated from their parents or legal guardian. The term can also include unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and trafficked children. When they arrive in Northern Ireland they are taken into the care of the local health trust. Eight children have gone missing since 2005 and they remain missing. The SDLP's health spokesman Mark H Durkan said he would be raising the issue at the Northern Ireland Assembly's health committee and his party colleague Alex Attwood would be raising it at the justice committee. ""The number of children who cannot be accounted for is something that needs urgent inquiry and investigation,"" he said. ""There is a lot of very good work being done to look after the welfare of unaccompanied young people, but clearly we now have some very big questions that need to be answered."" Ulster Unionist MLA Jo-Anne Dobson said it was ""frankly appalling"" to hear that eight children had gone missing. ""I have written to Health Minister Michelle O'Neill on this issue to seek further clarification and to demand details of how the department, health trusts and the Health and Social Care Board have sought to address each of the cases involved in the investigation,"" she added.

Some residents have appealed to the Saudi authorities to help them leave and families have been given accommodation in a nearby town, Saudi media reported. Shia residents of the region around the city of Qatif have long complained that they are marginalised and discriminated against by the Sunni monarchy. In May the UN criticised the Saudi attempt to demolish Awamiya's 400-year-old al-Masora quarter, home to between 2,000 and 3,000 people, saying it threatened historical and cultural heritage. The Saudi authorities had imposed power cuts on residents to try to make them leave, said the UN Special Rapporteur on housing, Leilani Farha. Anti-government demonstrations in Eastern Province began after the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, and protests and attacks have become more frequent since the January 2016 execution of the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr.

Hundreds of locals and conservation department staff have been trying to save the survivors since early Friday morning, and have formed a human chain to refloat the whales. Scientists do not know what exactly causes whales to beach themselves. But it sometimes happens because the whales are old and sick, injured, or make navigational errors particularly along gentle sloping beaches. Sometimes when one whale is beached, it will send out a distress signal attracting other members of its pod, who then also get stranded by a receding tide. The conservation department said it had received a report about a possible stranding on Thursday night, but did not launch the rescue operation until Friday morning as it was too dangerous to attempt a rescue in the dark, reported the New Zealand Herald. Andrew Lamason, the departments regional manager, said it was one of the largest mass beachings recorded in New Zealand. New Zealand marine mammal charity Project Jonah. which is leading efforts to save the whales said a total of 416 whales were stranded. It said the surviving whales are ""being kept cool, calm and comfortable"" by medics and members of the public. Some of the refloated whales tried to swim back to shore, and the human chain was trying to herd them out to deeper waters, said volunteer Ana Wiles. She told news outlet Stuff that there were ""so many fins in the air, no breathing"". ""We managed to float quite a few whales off and there were an awful lot of dead ones in the shallows so it was really, really sad."" ""One of the nicest things was we managed to float off a couple [of whales] and they had babies and the babies were following,"" Ms Wiles added. New Zealand has one of the highest stranding rates in the world, with about 300 dolphins and whales ending up on beaches every year, according to Project Jonah.. Many of these incidents happen at Farewell Spit. Experts say its shallow waters seems to confuse whales and hinder their ability to navigate.

The ultrasound scanners, complete with cold jelly, are being used to detect corrosion in pipes. The Dyce-based company hopes the technology centre will help them get their product to new customers. Managing director Tim Walsh said: ""What we are hoping and expecting from the technology centre is that it will allow us as an organisation that has solutions to particular problems that we know exist to get a better connection with end users and clients and get more traction. ""We want them to allow us to take them out into the field, give us the opportunity to demonstrate to potential clients that the technology works and that the technology can actually allow them to do what we want them to do."" The Oil and Gas Technology centre will invest in small firms with solid ideas and help pair some of those developers with the offshore operators that need them. Chief executive Colette Cohen said: ""We have much more operators in the north sea now, I think it's about 60 operators whereas back in the 80s it was about five or six, so it is a hugely different world. ""Those smaller operators don't have a technology organisation. They're not big enough and they can't support that, it wouldn't be economic. ""So this is a time when we can provide that service to them."" The new centre will build on the existing work being carried out by Aberdeen's two universities. At Robert Gordon University they have a drilling-rig simulator where they train students and refresh the skills of those in the industry. They will now be able to incorporate new technologies into their models to see if they work effectively. Prof Phil Hassard said: ""They'll be able to get the results back from that... they can be tested here and are more cost effective than trying to do it on a real rig.""

In a statement, the couple's families said they were ""deeply shocked and saddened by their tragic deaths"". The couple, who have four sons aged between 11 and 17, were staying in the Moroccan resort of Essaouira. Mrs Lamb's brother-in-law, Mark Rogerson, said the children were back in the UK being looked after by relatives. He said they knew very few details about what happened, but were aware of Mrs Lamb's death last Thursday and then heard about her husband's death on Monday.

261,35954305,"Teams discussed the failure of the new elimination format with F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone and Jean Todt, president of governing body, the FIA. Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said Todt and Ecclestone refused to revert to the 2015 system despite teams' wishes to do so. A new aggregate system proposed by the FIA will be discussed again next week. Lewis Hamilton qualified fastest for Sunday's race in Bahrain, but there were quiet periods near the end of the first and second sessions when there were no cars out on the track. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said all parties had agreed that the new system introduced on the eve of the 2016 season - where the slowest car is eliminated every 90 seconds in three sessions - was not the way forward. Horner said: ""There is an unwillingness from the promoter and FIA to go back to 2015. The teams would go back. A compromise has been put on the table now for the teams to consider. ""Let's have a look at what's been out on the table today. The bottom line is if we don't agree to a compromise, then we're stuck with what we've got and everybody agrees that what we've got isn't right."" Horner and Wolff both said they did not know why Ecclestone and Todt were so opposed to reverting to the 2015 system, whereby all eligible cars ran to the end of a session before the slowest few in each are knocked out, gradually reducing the number of cars over the three sessions. Todt said in a news conference on Saturday that race promoters had asked for a different system because they feared the 2015 approach was not exciting enough. Ecclestone has made it clear he wants to find a way to shuffle the grids so that the fastest cars are not always at the front. Horner said that the proposal was for a reversion to the 2015 format, but with each drivers' two fastest laps being counted towards their grid position rather than just their fastest. Horner said the plan ""needed a bit more investigation, perhaps with an aggregate time of two laps rather than a single lap. So it needs to be properly thought through and considered before voting on it.""","A new aggregate system proposed by the FIA will be discussed again next week.

262,33098672,"The Arches announced on Wednesday that it had gone into administration. Management said they had been left with no choice after a midnight closing time was imposed on its nightclub by the city's licensing board. The restriction followed police complaints about drug abuse and disorder. It was said to have cut total revenues at the Arches by more than 50%, making it untenable as a business. Sandra White, the SNP MSP for Glasgow Kelvin, raised the plight of the venue at First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament, where Deputy First Minister John Swinney was standing in for Nicola Sturgeon during her trip to the US. Ms White said 130 jobs had been put at risk by the Arches going into administration. She added: ""Aside from the fact that the Arches is one of Glasgow's most cultural venues, this is obviously a very worrying time for the staff facing redundancy. ""Can the deputy first minister assure those affected that the Scottish Government will offer all the support that it can?"" Mr Swinney replied: ""Creative Scotland is working hard with the organisation and with other partners to explore options regarding the future of arts programming of this nature in Glasgow. ""Creative Scotland agreed with Glasgow Life and Glasgow City Council to bring forward some of this year's support for the Arches - £92,000 from Creative Scotland and £37,000 from Glasgow City Council - to assist with the delivery of the current arts programme in the short-term. ""I reassure Sandra White that we will look in all ways that we possibly can do to assist in safeguarding the future of what I recognise as a significant cultural venue in the city of Glasgow and a venue that contributes a great deal to the cultural life of Scotland."" Ms White said she was now calling on Glasgow City Council, Police Scotland and the management of the Arches to get round the table and ""see what can be done to either reverse the closure or see what can be done to reopen the doors as soon as possible"". The Scottish government has also said staff potentially affected the Arches going into administration would be supported through the Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (Pace) initiative. The Arches has received £11.2m of public funding, including £3.8m of capital funding, through Creative Scotland and previously the Scottish Arts Council over the past 20 years.","The Arches announced on Wednesday that it had gone into administration.

263,34423371,"Councillors are to meet next week to consider bids to turn the hall into a food market or a hotel, with council officials backing the food hall plan. However a number of pre-conditions would need to be met before a draft lease could be agreed, at the authority's February meeting. The B-listed Edwardian building has sat empty since it closed 10 years ago. Councillors deferred a decision on which development bid to back, if any, in July, calling for further reports from Historic Scotland and other agencies and further information from the applicants. At that stage, council officials had backed the view of independent property specialists Jones Laing LaSalle that the Perth Market Place Ltd proposal should be preferred to the hotel bid from the Seventy Group. A report to councillors ahead of Wednesday's full council meeting noted that ""there has been a change in circumstances which significantly impacts upon the Seventy Group's bid"", meaning no further information could be provided. Planning and development head David Littlejohn has asked councillors to give the marketplace proposal ""preferred bidder status"" to allow detailed negotiations to take place. Should this happen, a draft lease could potentially be considered by the council in February 2016, although this would also have to be signed off by the Perth Common Good Fund Committee. The Edwardian building, which dates back to 1911, was closed 10 years ago after a modern new concert hall was opened in the city. Decisions over its future have been drawn out over a decade since then, with councillors at one point approving plans to have it demolished, which were subsequently blocked by Historic Scotland opposition. The development management committee then backed the Seventy Group plans to convert it into a luxury hotel, before councillors agreed to publicly market a 125-year lease on the building to find an alternative to demolition. Five bids were submitted in January, which where whittled down to two by July when councillors deferred the decision. Should neither bid ultimately win approval, demolition could still be an option, although Historic Scotland chief executive Ian Walford warned he would be minded to object to such a move. Mr Littlejohn also noted in his report that Historic Scotland had underlined that ""the process cannot be allowed to perpetuate"", and that a decision will have to be made.","The B-listed Edwardian building has sat empty since it closed 10 years ago.

He had trained with Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith at Huntingdon Gym, but believes returning home will improve his Olympic prospects. ""It will open a lot of doors for me,"" the former British senior squad member told BBC Look East. MacKenzie is a European junior team gold medallist with Britain and finished second in the vault and sixth in the all-around at last year's national championships. He has also represented the senior squad at national level, but the prospect of competing for Team GB at major international events was being restricted by the country's world-class roster, with Smith, Max Whitlock, Sam Oldham, Kristian Thomas and Dan Keatings all rivals for selection. ""I would say I feel more South African than British,"" said MacKenzie, who was born in the coastal town of Jeffreys Bay. ""I won a competition for GB in South Africa in 2010. I remember standing up there on the podium with the British anthem playing and thought it didn't quite feel right. ""I've been here 11 years. I have a British passport, but I can't really forget I was born in Africa and my parents were. I can't forget my heritage that quickly."" MacKenzie has already made an impact on South African gymnastics, winning a Commonwealth Games qualifier in October to secure his place at Glasgow this summer and, under the British flag, finished highest at the 2013 national championships. And he will compete in the Africa championships at the end of March, in the hope of making the qualifying scores needed to become the first South African artistic gymnast to go to the Olympics since 1956. MacKenzie, who is now based at the Centurion Gymnastics Centre, intends to continue working with his Huntingdon coach Paul Hall and will send videos of his progress to receive tuition. ""I can really make a difference to gymnastics as a whole there and maybe kickstart something,"" he said.
