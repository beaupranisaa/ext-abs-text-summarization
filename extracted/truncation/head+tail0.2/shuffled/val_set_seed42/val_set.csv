But the Argentine government says it will not back down in its decision to nationalise YPF, which it says is a lawful action taken in the national interest. ""We will try to pressurise Argentina so that it sees that this road is going nowhere,"" he said after meeting Hillary Clinton. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced the measure on Monday, saying she was asserting sovereignty over Argentina's energy resources. It says YPF did not invest enough to increase output from its oil fields, forcing Argentina to rely on imports. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said Spain would also raise the issue with the IMF, the World Bank and the G-20. He added that Spain and the US had agreed to work together to ""re-establish international legality"". EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. But Argentine officials said they were not worried by possible reprisals over the nationalisation. Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also offered support. ""There are going to be very clear interventions on the part of the European Union,"" Trade Secretary Jaime Garcia Legaz said, without revealing further details. Repsol has said it wants around $10bn for its stake in YPF, but Argentina has said it does not accept that valuation. The move has wide support in Argentina but has provoked outrage in Spain, which has threatened reprisals. Her government is taking 51% of YPF, wiping out Repsol's 57.4% majority stake. ""We are not worried about any kind of reprisals,"" he added. Last year it announced huge new finds of shale oil and gas. YPF, Argentina's biggest oil company, was privatised in 1993. It is not clear what any reprisals might involve. ""The government takes its decisions thinking about the Argentine people and not what the US or the Spanish government think,"" Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo said. The Spanish government will consider what measures to take at a cabinet meeting on Friday, and has also been rallying international support.","Spanish Trade Secretary Jaime Garcia Legaz said the EU would intervene over Argentina's seizure of the controlling stake in YPF from Spanish firm Repsol.

But he warned the myth may be too entrenched to shake off: ""People will still believe stress causes heart attacks after this story has been and gone. The results showed that whether people were ""never"", ""usually"" or ""mostly"" happy had no impact on their odds of dying during the duration of the study once other factors such as health or whether they smoked were taken into account. A series of studies had shown that how happy people are, strongly predicts how long they are going to live. But the research team in the UK and Australia said those studies failed to deal with reverse causality - namely, that people who are ill are not very happy. He said it could have indirect effects if people started consuming large amounts of alcohol or massively overeating, but happiness itself ""does not have any material, direct, effect on mortality"". But the decade-long analysis, published in the Lancet, said previous studies had just confused cause and effect. Co-author Prof Sir Richard Peto, from the University of Oxford, said light smokers had double the risk of an early death and regular smokers had three times the risk of dying during the study period, but that happiness was ""irrelevant"". Ideas included detrimental changes in stress hormones or the immune system resulting in a higher risk of death. However, experts argued that unhappiness in childhood may still have a lasting impact. In a commentary, Dr Philipe de Souto Barreto and professor Yves Rolland from the University Hospital of Toulouse in France, said: ""Further research from a lifecourse perspective is needed since happiness during critical periods, such as childhood, could have important consequences on health in adulthood.""

Fighting that broke out in the capital, Juba, in July is responsible for the latest surge in those fleeing, it says. The UN says more than 185,000 people have fled South Sudan since July. The UN wants to deploy a 4,000-strong regional protection force for Juba which would have a more robust mandate than the 12,000 UN soldiers already in the country, however the mandate and size of the force still have to be agreed. A fall-out between President Salva Kiir and former Vice-President Machar - the most powerful members of their respective Dinka and Nuer ethnic groups - led to the civil war which erupted in December 2013. They only agreed to settle their differences under intense international pressure, signing a peace deal in August 2015 - and Mr Machar returned to Juba as vice-president in a unity government in April. A fragile peace deal signed last year is on the brink of collapse. ""The violence in July came as a major setback to peace efforts in South Sudan,"" the UNHCR spokesman Leo Dobbs said in a statement.

The Xylella blight has previously ravaged vineyards in California and citrus groves in Brazil, EFSA says. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) says the disease, which kills trees by desiccation, is spread by various sap-sucking insects. A local campaign group called Peacelink disputes the EU data on the disease, however, arguing that a fungal infection is most likely to blame. The Commission says at least 10% of the 11 million olive trees in Lecce are infected. Those strips should be free of species vulnerable to the disease, so that the blight is contained. It wants Italy to destroy infected trees and restrict any trade in species vulnerable to the disease. Just cutting down trees with symptoms might not be enough,"" he said. New emergency measures are to be proposed by the Commission this week. ""Even trees not showing symptoms might carry the bacteria, which makes it really difficult.

Thousands of hectares of olives are affected by the outbreak - a major worry for Italy, which is the EU's second biggest olive oil producer after Spain. In a letter to EU Health and Food Safety Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis, Peacelink says more than 500 olive trees treated for fungi have recovered since spring last year.

A wider survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) reported that the stock of houses per surveyor has fallen to its lowest level for at least 37 years. Based on average prices, anyone buying a property in Kensington and Chelsea can now expect to pay more than Â£118,000 in stamp duty alone. However, prices in the London suburbs - and other parts of England and Wales - continued to hit new highs, said LSL. In Westminster it claimed there had been a fall of 22% between a peak in November and the end of May. The company said that Kensington and Chelsea had seen prices plummet by 16% since a peak in September 2014. Thirteen outer London boroughs saw prices hit new highs. Buyers of properties worth less than Â£937,000 now pay less in stamp duty than they used to.

But the Department for Transport said the total cost of carrying ministers' paperwork was just 5% of the total spent on the Government Car Service‎ and that it was committed to ensuring the service provided value for money. The red boxes travelled alone using the Government Car Service 1,910 times between 2012-13 and 2014-15, with the number of journeys rising over the course of the three years. The practice of carrying ministers' ""red boxes"" in official cars is used for sensitive documentation. The government said there had been a ""substantial reduction"" in the cost of ministerial cars since 2011. David Cameron announced plans to shrink the bill for ministerial cars shortly after coming to office in 2010, and the number of ministers with access to their own chauffeur-driven car was cut. The total bill could be higher as figures for additional trips using pool cars were not available. A Freedom of Information request by the Huffington Post UK found the cost of a journey transporting just government documents had often exceeded £100. ""We have also been working hard to cut our operating costs in order to further reduce the cost to the public purse. In 2010, journalist Sarah Vine, the wife of the then education secretary Michael Gove, wrote that while her husband could travel home by public transport, his red box would travel separately ""in air-conditioned splendour, snug and secure in the back of a locked car"". After April 2012, cars were allocated to departments as departmental pool cars for use by ministers.

""Sports, Ethics and Religion"" - the title of an undergraduate course at this US college in New Hampshire. Money seems to have been central to this one, according to the Cuban authorities. Some face a one-term suspension, the college says. They then left the test centres early to find out the answers. The ethics element seems to have been a bit lost on some students though. The scam involved the use of earpieces last October. Some of these apparently fell into the wrong hands, enabling students to cheat. In Shaanxi province, 2,440 pharmacists were accused of cheating in a national licensing test according to China's state TV. Fake candidates were sent into exams to get hold of the questions, the South China Morning Post reports. Many students smuggled in textbooks and notes into the examination centres despite tight security. Other officers were accused of knowing about the cheating but failing to do anything about it. Ten Atlanta teachers have been jailed after investigators found wrong answers on test papers were erased and children told the right answers. Thousands of of secondary school pupils in Havana were obliged to re-sit their exams, official newspaper Granma said. Several hundred people have been arrested in connection with mass school exam cheating in the Indian state of Bihar. Candidates who had paid the scammers the appropriate fee then received the correct answers through their earpieces. At issue were electronic hand-held clickers registered to individual students to answer questions in class. The incentive - financial bonuses for good marks. Red faces all round when allegations emerged in January that 34 US Air Force officers in charge of launching US nuclear missiles had cheated in proficiency tests. According to the US Air Force, some staff had sent answers by text message to others at the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. Here are five more notorious examples of exam cheating.

That deal included rules that mean players based outside Wales could also be overlooked in favour of home-based talent, with coach Gatland expected to tighten selection policy. Racing Metro centre Roberts, 28, is understood to have rejected Cardiff Blues and agreed to join Quins after the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The selection policy ruled that no player based overseas should represent Wales, although Gatland is able to make exceptions. In August 2014, the Welsh Rugby Union and Wales' four professional regions signed a £60m, six-year deal that settled a long-running dispute over the sport's future. ""The ideal for me is you want players playing in Wales,"" Gatland said at an event where tickets went on sale for Wales' World Cup warm-up matches. Wales host Ireland on Saturday, 8 August, visit Dublin on Saturday, 29 August, and then welcome Italy to the Millennium Stadium on Saturday, 5 September. ""They do play outside of Wales but they could be selected, but I think the long-term goal is to have a policy where, ideally, we pick players who are playing in Wales."" Head coach Gatland has previously stated he would prefer Welsh internationals to play in Wales. Under the so-called 'Gatland's Law', Wales-based players are likely to be favoured for Test selection over those who choose to play elsewhere. ""There's not a hard and fast rule as there is with England,"" Gatland told BBC Wales Sport. ""There are exceptions where players have been playing outside of Wales and there are one or two wildcards we could pick. ""That will encourage players to stay and encourage players to come back to Wales."" However, that only applied to players who moved before the deal was agreed, and so at the time would not have applied to Roberts, who joined Racing in June 2013. English players who move to play abroad are currently not considered for national team selection. A move to Harlequins now would bring the centre into the category of players who could be overlooked for selection, though Gatland remains pragmatic on the matter.

There are suspicions that Azerbaijan influenced PACE's rejection of a report on Azeri political prisoners in 2013. The council - not part of the EU - monitors compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, and judges in Strasbourg enforce it. Opponents of President Ilham Aliyev have been jailed on various charges, including tax evasion, spying and weapons possession. The criticisms concern some members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), accused of doing favours for Azerbaijan. They said PACE's integrity was threatened by ""recent, serious and credible allegations of grave misconduct"" by some fellow MPs. The investigators are: PACE elects the judges at the ECHR, whose human rights rulings are binding on Council of Europe states. As part of the inquiry, PACE plans to revise its code of conduct. They can recommend action against any PACE members implicated in corruption.

53,40387580,"The officer asks for Mr DuBose's driver's licence, but he says he does not have it. A prosecutor called it the ""most asinine act"" ever by a police officer. The Cincinnati officer killed Sam DuBose, 43, after pulling him over on 19 July 2015. The jurors told the judge they were almost evenly split. Mr Tensing was fired last year by the University of Cincinnati, which announced an overhaul of its policing department. But an expert said his frame-by-frame analysis of Mr Tensing's body camera video showed he was not being dragged by the car. It is the fourth high-profile failure recently to convict a police officer in the death of a black man: Mr Tensing stopped Mr DuBose near campus for a missing front licence plate, and police body cam shows their initial exchange was friendly. The officer fired a single round, hitting Mr DuBose in the head. Mr Tensing's first trial last year also ended with the jury deadlocked. Mr Tensing had testified that he feared he could be run over as Mr DuBose tried to drive away. Judge Leslie Ghiz declared the mistrial on Friday after the jury of nine white and three black people were unable to reach a verdict. ""It shows our legal system has no value for African-American human rights,"" said Ms Bailey, reports the Cincinnati Enquirer. Donyetta Bailey, who is president of the Black Lawyer's Association of Cincinnati, said the Tensing case and others underline that juries are ""implicitly biased"" in favour of police officers. Mr Tensing then asks Mr DuBose to unbuckle his seatbelt. The university also reached a $5.3m (Â£4.1m) settlement with Mr DuBose's family, including free undergraduate tuition for his 13 children.

The Taiwanese were detained when they went to a police station last week to retrieve their passports. On Monday, Taiwan's foreign affairs ministry accused Chinese officials of ""obstructions"", including delaying the court order and preventing Taiwan's representative from reaching the acquitted. China has not responded in detail to the allegations, but has criticised Taiwan for not considering itself as part of ""one China"". Taiwan said the eight were among 23 Taiwanese people who were accused in Kenya of being members of a telephone fraud ring, which also included Chinese nationals.

63,33421376,"The new rules oblige doctors to inform women about the risks and ask them to sign a consent form before performing a caesarean. Gynaecologist Renato Sa told BBC Brasil: ""Doctors are responsible for what happens and in a situation of risk they chose a caesarean, because if there is a death or complication they will be asked why they didn't do this. The new rules are designed to reduce unnecessary surgical procedures, and ensure pregnant women are aware of the risks associated with caesareans. Doctors are afraid of natural childbirth."" They will have to fill in a complete record of how the labour and birth developed and explain their actions. Women who want to give birth naturally in a private hospital have reported finding all the beds are reserved for scheduled deliveries. There have been numerous reports of women going into labour without a caesarean scheduled and being forced to travel from hospital to hospital in search of a bed. Researchers say many women also see caesareans as more civilised and modern, and natural birth as primitive, ugly and inconvenient. Eighty-five per cent of all births in Brazilian private hospitals are caesareans and in public hospitals the figure is 45%. Doctors will also have to justify why a caesarean was necessary. Many doctors prefer caesareans too, as they can plan the time of a birth, and feel more protected from litigation. Each pregnant woman will now be assigned medical notes which record the history of her pregnancy, which she can take with her if she changes doctors. However, experts say that a scarcity of maternity beds and wards equipped to deal with natural births means that for many women in Brazil, caesarean birth is seen as the best option. In Brazil's body-conscious culture, where there is little information given about childbirth, there is also huge concern that natural birth can make women sexually unattractive. ""The best way to guarantee yourself a bed in a good hospital is to book a caesarean,"" Pedro Octavio de Britto Pereira, an obstetrician and professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said in an interview with BBC Brasil last year.","The new rules oblige doctors to inform women about the risks and ask them to sign a consent form before performing a caesarean.

The 17-year-old was in the quarry with three teenage friends when they fell into the water from a makeshift raft. He said: ""They knew over the past day, or from about eight o'clock last night (20:00 BST) that although they would have liked to have thought there was a chance he would be still alive, they knew that he was gone and their hope was that the body would be found sooner rather than later."" The body of Rhys Jack was recovered from the disused quarry in the Backtown area of Strabane on Tuesday afternoon. Father Doherty told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that Rhys's parents, Elaine and Mark, identified his body at the quarry shortly after it was recovered by search teams. Father Doherty has been with members of the Jack family since the tragedy began to unfold on Monday evening. The teenager who died in a water-filled quarry in County Tyrone is the third member of his extended family to die in a drowning tragedy. He described the atmosphere in Rhys's school as ""subdued"" and said staff had tried to make special arrangements for those taking exams. The requiem mass was held at St Mary's Church on the Melmount Road. He explained that the corpse of Elaine Jack's young brother had never been found, so they were relieved that Rhys's body had been recovered. Parish priest, Father Michael Doherty, said both of the teenager's parents had lost family members through drowning. His three friends, who were later rescued, had frantically tried to save him. His mother lost her five-year-old brother about 40 years ago, while his father's uncle drowned in recent years. He was also a chaplain at the teenager's school. Father Doherty was the Jack family's parish priest and had baptised Rhys 17 years ago. The priest said that their ""deep sadness"" at losing their son was mixed with ""relief"". He also said it was his understanding that Mark Jack's uncle had drowned in the River Finn a number of years ago.","The priest said the three friends who had tried to save Rhys were ""traumatised and upset"".

Police arrested the 33-year-old suspect and three other men, saying they had found a Zastava pistol and several cartridges, as well as 36 tickets for Thursday's match. As the team bus arrived in Tirana, stones were thrown and a window was cracked. The two countries have had a long and bitter history of rivalry, and ethnic-Albanian-majority Kosovo's decision to declare independence from Serbia in 2008 brought relations to a new low. Tensions had already been high before the Euro 2016 tie at the Partizan Stadium in Belgrade and ordinary Albanian fans were not allowed to attend the match. Serbian media reported that Albanian officials had refused to receive a note of protest from Belgrade, insisting nothing had happened. Last year's match had to be abandoned as Serbian fans invaded the pitch and attacked Albanian players. Ismail Morinaj admitted flying the drone from a church across the road from the stadium. Only a few dozen Serb supporters will be allowed into the stadium for Thursday's match, which will have a heavy police presence. Albania are third in their Euro 2016 qualifying group, behind Portugal and Denmark, but far ahead of Serbia and still hoping to qualify for the knock-out stages of the competition. Although the match will take place in Elbasan, an hour's drive to the south-east of Tirana, the Serbia team are staying at a hotel in the capital surrounded by police. The ensuing brawl and the decision to abandon the game prompted football officials to deduct three points from Serbia, and they stand at the bottom of their group in Euro 2016.

The Department of Health supported the move, but Labour argued it suggested there was a financial crisis in the NHS that was ""spiralling out of control"". Rosters should be rigorously managed to deploy staff efficiently across all required shifts, including evenings and weekends, he said. It urged money-saving measures such as filling only essential staff vacancies. The provider sector has forecast a total deficit of more than £2bn for 2015-16, according to specialist resource Health Service Journal.

""We have had three attacks involving fatalities and six thwarted attacks in the past 12 months,"" he said.

The Los Angeles-based artist collaborated with comparative psychologist Dr Sarah-Jane Vick to develop Primate Cinema: Apes as family. Other new commissions include a pavilion made from salvaged materials and artworks made from rubble in skips. Major international artists include Hermann Nitsch, Melvin Moti, Dieter Roth and Rachel Mayeri. One Thousand Points of Light features a new film focusing on light-reactive minerals and objects the artist has chosen from National Museums of Scotland's collections, ranging from fluorescing fossils to a glowing jellyfish. Another major exhibition will feature the work of Van Gogh and Kandinsky, at the Scottish National Gallery. As well as the major artists, there is an exhibition by TV presenter Harry Hill, who will also be performing during the Fringe, entitled My Hobby. Dutch artist Melvin Moti is holding his first UK solo show, at the National Museums of Scotland. There are new commissions from Susan Philipsz, Andrew Miller, Emily Speed, Kevin Harman and Anthony Schrag. Scots-born sound artist Philipsz, who won the Turner prize in 2010, will bring Timelines to the capital - a multi-site installation, developed in response to one of Edinburgh's famous One O'Clock Gun.

Meanwhile, the Syrian government has intensified its offensive on east Aleppo, monitors and activists say. Once Syria's commercial and industrial hub, Aleppo has been divided roughly in two since 2012, with the government controlling the west and rebels the east. Rebels launched a counter-attack in an attempt to break the siege in late October. Meanwhile at least 32 people have been killed in intense Syrian air strikes on rebel-held east Aleppo, monitors say. ""There was an escalation in the evening, with successive bombardments,"" SOHR director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP news agency, adding that many people were trapped under rubble. The soldier, who has not been named, died after the device detonated in Ayn Issa, north of the IS stronghold Raqqa. It is the first such death since US special forces deployed in Syria in October 2015. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors casualties, said the attack was one of the heaviest since Syrian forces resumed an offensive on the east earlier this month. But their progress slowed after early gains. Syrian forces stepped up ground and air attacks on eastern Aleppo in November following a three-week moratorium. In late September, two weeks after encircling the east and reimposing a siege on its estimated 275,000 residents, the army launched an all-out assault to take full control of the city. Five children were reported to be among the dead. US Defence Secretary Ash Carter said the soldier's death was a ""painful reminder of the dangers our men and women in uniform face around the world to keep us safe"".

Schweinsteiger, 31, looks like being one of nine players who may leave. Of the other players who did not train with the United squad on Thursday, Januzaj has had the biggest fall from grace. Injury restricted Schweinsteiger to 31 appearances and he was involved in just seven of United's final 34 games, including missing the FA Cup final win over Crystal Palace. He injured a knee on international duty in March and only returned at Euro 2016, when he scored on his first appearance, as a substitute, against Ukraine. Mourinho has already made three big summer signings and is closing in on Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba. He then featured for 17 minutes in three substitute appearances. Since his arrival, Mourinho has signed Villarreal defender Eric Bailly for about £30m, midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan from Borussia Dortmund for an undisclosed fee and former Paris St Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a free transfer. With all the other senior players who were absent from the recent tour of China present, Schweinsteiger's absence from Thursday's squad training session is being viewed as significant. United paid a reported £14.4m to sign him from Bayern Munich 12 months ago but the move did not work out as planned. He did not start a league game and the German side were happy to let United cut the deal short midway through the season when Louis van Gaal's squad were badly affected by injury.

Many have received versions for free via the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a charity. ""There was no expectation that adults would use Raspberry Pi, no expectation of commercial success and certainly no expectation that four years later we would be manufacturing tens of thousands of units a day in the UK and exporting Raspberry Pi all over the world."" However, it can also be used for many practical purposes such as streaming music to several devices in a house. A new starter kit for Raspberry Pi, including a keyboard and mouse, has been released to celebrate the success. The Raspberry Pi Zero, a version of the computer that costs Â£4, was ideal for use in developing countries, he added. ""They can run off batteries so where there isn't an abundance of electricity you still have a computer that can be used for teaching."" The Pi, which is manufactured in Wales, has been adopted by pupils, programmers and inventors around the world.

Jim Murphy was responding to former Tory chairman Lord Baker's view that there could be a deal between the two rival parties after May's election. However, the Labour MP has not ruled out some kind of deal with the SNP. Writing in The Independent, Lord Baker of Dorking said a Labour minority government reliant on the SNP would be a ""nightmare"" situation at Westminster. Mr Murphy added that the differences between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party were bigger than ""I have seen for a number of years"". He added that such an arrangement could ""stretch the constitution of our country to breaking point"". On the suggestion of his party entering into a Conservative arrangement in the event of a hung parliament, Mr Murphy was very clear. Mr Murphy said he had no desire to focus on the ""politics of pessimism"" because he wanted his party to win government. The debate over coalition deals has arisen because polling suggests neither Labour nor the Conservatives would gain an overall majority in this year's election. Mr Murphy told BBC political editor Brian Taylor that it was ""disrespectful"" to discuss political deals before the general election. Asked if a deal with the nationalists was possible, Mr Murphy said he did not want to get into a ""post-match analysis on an event that has not yet taken place"". If that is the case a coalition deal with smaller parties could be possible or a so-called ""confidence and supply"" arrangement could be agreed whereby the smaller party supports the larger party in key votes. He told Brian Taylor during a half-hour webcast: ""As I say, if the SNP want to vote for our policies in the House of Commons, it's up to them - some time they have done that in recent times, quite often they have sided with the Tories against Labour."" He said: ""We don't need lessons from Tory dinosaurs about how to run Scotland, what a ludicrous idea.""

Investigators have found signs of metal fatigue in components from the aircraft that crashed off Norway in April, killing 13 people. The Super Puma H225 helicopter had already grounded in the UK and Norway since the crash but the latest EASA directive includes the other main variant of the Super Puma and extends the ban across Europe. The pilots had no time to issue a mayday and the main rotor is believed to have become detached before impact. Iain Stuart from Aberdeenshire was among those killed in the crash. An online petition calling for all Super Puma 225s to be ""permanently removed from service"" has attracted nearly 30,000 signatures. On Wednesday a preliminary report issued by the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) said it had found ""features strongly consistent with fatigue"" in parts of the main gearbox (MGB).

Falls in clothing and food prices were the main contributors to the change in the rate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. ""Inflation has continued its pattern of recent months, when prices have been very little changed on the previous year,"" said Philip Gooding from the ONS. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said the latest figure was good news for consumers. The ONS said the rate was also affected by a smaller rise in air fares in June than a year ago. ""With earnings growth currently seeing clear improvement and employment high and rising, purchasing power is currently in rude heath,"" he added. ""The headline rate for June has dropped very slightly on May, back to zero, thanks to small downwards effects from movements in clothing and food prices and air fares."" Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said he expects inflation to remain low in the immediate short term. He said that attention would now turn to Wednesday's wage growth data, ""The Bank of England needs to determine whether pay growth will continue to accelerate as firms compete for staff, or whether low inflation will keep the overall rate of increase below levels that would normally worry the monetary policy committee into hiking interest rates,"" he added. But the Bank expects it to start picking up around the turn of the year. The fear is that people will defer spending in the hope that goods or services will become cheaper later.

103,28872944,"Experts warn more studies are needed before any change in protocols. The scientists emphasise evidence backs good hand-washing and suggests people with the bug should bathe daily using antibacterial solutions. But good hand hygiene and bathing with antibacterial solutions are key to reducing infections, they say. Prof Gerd Fatkenheuer, from the University Hospital Cologne, Germany, who was part of the research team said: ""In the haste to do something against the rising tide of MRSA infection, measures were adopted that seemed plausible but were not properly assessed, bundling the effective and harmless with the ineffective and harmful. The bug is resistant to most antibiotics and while it is can be carried harmlessly on the skin it may lead to serious wound infections - particularly in people who are already unwell. Recent figures for England suggest 862 cases of MRSA were recorded in the year 2013-14, a substantial reduction from the 4,451 cases reported in 2007-08. ""We know for example that isolating patients can result in anxiety and depression and fewer visits by doctors and nurses."" Hospitals have used a varied combination of methods to tackle it, including: Scientists reviewed studies over the last decade. ""So we need to make sure that studies clearly show that we will not do harm by stopping some or all of these isolation methods."" Prof Peter Collignon at the Canberra Hospital, Australia said: ""Certain countries, however, that take all of these combined approaches - such as the Netherlands and Denmark - have the lowest rates of MRSA spread in healthcare facilities. But most investigated several infection control measures in combination, making it difficult to tease out which ones worked best. And they recommend scarce resources could be redeployed to combat other infections - rather than singling out MRSA. Researchers say the limited evidence focusing solely on isolation or screening suggest they may not reduce spread of the disease and could do more harm than good. The report authors say as MRSA levels continue to drop this provides a good opportunity to reassess how best to tackle the problem. Despite rates of Meticillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) falling in many countries, concerns about its spread remain. Researchers suggest there is poor evidence to support screening and isolating infected patients - standard practice in hospitals worldwide.","Experts warn more studies are needed before any change in protocols. The scientists emphasise evidence backs good hand-washing and suggests people with the bug should bathe daily using antibacterial solutions. But good hand hygiene and bathing with antibacterial solutionsCertain countries, however, that take all of these combined approaches - such as the Netherlands and Denmark - have the lowest rates of MRSA spread in healthcare facilities. But most investigated several infection control measures in combination, making it difficult to tease out which ones worked best. And they recommend scarce resources could be redeployed to combat other infections - rather than singling out MRSA. Researchers say the limited evidence focusing solely on isolation or screening suggest they may not reduce spread of the disease and could do more harm than good.

The UK government had claimed that an exemption in the law around air pollution for plants burning low volatile coal was aimed at sites such as Aberthaw, given that the anthracite coal it uses is sourced locally, harder to burn and important to the local economy. RWE said it was ""disappointed"" with the advocate general's opinion but would await the final EU court judgement. The UK government has said it wants all coal-fired power stations to close by 2025.

Christine Swabey, chief executive of the autism research charity, Autistica, said there was an ""unacceptable imbalance"" between the high cost of autism and the amount spent on research. ""We need to use our resources earlier, identify people earlier and try to provide therapies and support that makes it easier to manage the condition,"" he told BBC News. This compared with £12bn for cancer, £8bn for heart disease and £5bn for stroke, said Autistica. Autism cost the UK more than heart disease, stroke and cancer combined, said an autism charity. The figures showed a clear need for more effective interventions to treat autism, ideally in early life, to make the best use of scarce resources, said lead researcher Prof Martin Knapp, of the London School of Economics and Political Science, in London. It amounts to £1.5m in the UK and $2.4m in the US for individuals with the highest needs, say UK and US experts. Autism cost the UK at least £32bn a year in terms of treatment, lost earnings, and care and support for children and adults with ASD, found the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics. The disorder varies from mild to so severe that a person may be unable to communicate and need round-the-clock care. The research looked at the costs to society of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in both the UK and US. He said new government policies were also needed to address ""the enormous impact on families"". But only £6.60 per person is spent on autism research compared with £295 on cancer, according to Autistica.

And Jenny North, policy and strategy director of Impetus PEF, which funds projects to help the most disadvantaged young people, called for more government action. But the figures also show the numbers were 5,000 higher than in the summer. England-only figures show there were 690,000 NEETs at the end of last year, almost 100,000 fewer than in the last quarter of 2014. So young people in England are now expected to stay in full-time education, in an apprenticeship, or in employment with training until they are 18. But campaigners say the figures are still too high ""More than one in every 10 teenagers is currently locked out of a path to the future,"" said Ms Donnelly. This figure is the lowest since 2000 when comparable records began and the number stood at 629,000, says the government. At the end of last year that proportion had fallen to 11.8%.

128,36732336,"Measuring the turbulence and movement of such gas is important because the size of galaxy clusters is a useful tool for measuring ""the parameters of cosmology and the growth of structure in the universe"", researchers say. ""Hitomi's Perseus observation tells us that we can probably weigh distant galaxy clusters to greater accuracy than we can weigh our own Milky Way galaxy."" Hitomi, which translates as the pupil of the eye in Japanese, was meant to spend years studying the formation of galaxy clusters and the warping of space and time around black holes. ""The gas is relatively stable and isn't getting pushed around as much as we thought,"" said Brian McNamara, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, who was part of the research team. In trying to correct it, on-board systems sent the craft into a spin until finally the solar panels that powered it are thought to have broken off. Launched in February, the Hitomi X-ray satellite began tumbling out of control in March when contact was finally lost. It cost more than a quarter of a billion dollars - the research was an international collaboration involving the American space agency Nasa, and teams in Japan and many other countries, including one at Cambridge University in the UK. The next time a similar satellite will be launched is in 2028 by the European Space Agency. Published in Nature, data revealed the movement of gas between galaxy clusters was not as turbulent as expected. The interaction between all the various gases was thought to be very chaotic so Hitomi's observations appear to have defied predictions. Scientists studying the data found that the hot gases between galaxies within the Perseus cluster was travelling at a slower speed - at 540,000 km/h (340,000 mph) - and in a less turbulent way than many expected. Hitomi was lost thanks to a sensor incorrectly detecting a roll in the spacecraft. Just before its demise, scientists managed to extract data measuring X-ray activity in the Perseus galaxy cluster. The gases in galaxy clusters are thought to be particularly hot and dense with a lot of dark matter and a supermassive black hole at the centre of it all.","Measuring the turbulence and movement of such gas is important because the size of galaxy clusters is a useful tool for measuring ""the parameters of cosmology and the growth of structure in the universe"", researchers say.

Fashion retailer Next said on Thursday it was ""extremely cautious"" about trading for the coming year as it reported lower annual profits.

138,38636222,"Lawyers and activists celebrated and chanted: ""These islands are Egyptian."" Cheers erupted as the judge delivered the verdict, saying the government had failed to provide evidence that the islands were originally Saudi. A group of lawyers, including former presidential candidate Khaled Ali, also challenged the agreement at an administrative court. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia was not established until 1932. The transfer deal, signed last April, sparked rare protests in Egypt. Mr Ali argued that a 1906 maritime treaty between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire stated that the islands were Egyptian. It is part of the State Council, a judicial body that gives legal advice to the government, drafts legislation, and exercises jurisdiction over administrative cases. On Monday, the High Administrative Court said it was the ""unanimous"" decision of its judges that Tiran and Sanafir were sovereign Egyptian territories. Saudi Arabia has backed Mr Sisi financially since he led the military's overthrow of his Islamist predecessor, Mohammed Morsi, in 2013. Tiran and Sanafir are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba. There was no immediate response from the Egyptian or Saudi governments. But Mr Sisi was accused of violating the constitution and ""selling"" the islands in return for a multi-billion dollar aid package announced during a visit to Cairo by King Salman. The High Administrative Court rejected an appeal by the government against a lower court's decision to stop it handing over Tiran and Sanafir. The government subsequently lodged an appeal with the High Administrative Court. They are uninhabited apart from Egyptian troops and multi-national peacekeepers. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi said the islands had always belonged to Saudi Arabia and that Riyadh had asked Egypt to station troops there in 1950 to protect them. In June, the court nullified the border accord, ruling that Egyptian sovereignty over the islands held and could not be amended in favour of another state. Uproar at the maritime border demarcation accord prompted protests across Egypt at which hundreds people were detained, according to human rights activists. ""This verdict is a victory for Egypt,"" Mr Ali, who was carried out of the court building on the shoulders of his supporters, told Reuters news agency.","Lawyers and activists celebrated and chanted: ""These islands are Egyptian.""

139,27600394,"But the military's actions in removing an elected government has drawn widespread international criticism. Correspondents say there is also a degree of scepticism about the total number of people in custody provided by the military, with reports of more widespread detentions. The country's information and technology ministry told the BBC there was a gateway problem. Coup leaders, who took power last week, received royal endorsement on Monday. It remains to be seen whether these ""red-shirt"" leaders - who support the ousted government - do the same, our correspondent adds. The military seized power in Thailand on 22 May, saying it wanted to return stability after months of unrest. On Monday, there were reports that internet users were briefly unable to access social media site Facebook. So far, almost all of the 124 people who the army said they had detained and released have kept a very low profile, says the BBC's Jonah Fisher in Bangkok. On Monday a royal command approved the coup. The move followed six months of political deadlock as protesters rallied against Ms Yingluck's government. Experts have said that the coup is unlikely to heal highly polarised political divisions in the country. Both have strong support in rural and northern areas, propelling them to successive election wins. The current deadlock dates from 2006, when the military ousted Ms Yingluck's brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, in a coup. The army also says it is releasing a group of ""red-shirt"" protest leaders who support the ousted government. At least 28 people were killed and hundreds injured during the protests. However, many in the middle class and urban elite, who comprise the heart of the anti-government movement that began in November 2013, oppose them bitterly. Conditions for the release appear to include agreeing to avoid political activity and informing the army of travel, a BBC correspondent says. Rights groups have expressed alarm over the detentions, as well as the tight restrictions on media. An army spokesman said a total of 253 people had been summoned. The anti-government protest leader has already been freed. Thailand's former prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, has been released but remains under some restrictions.

Team boss Wolff joined Mercedes from Williams in February 2013, and Lauda took up his position in late 2012. Their new contracts coincide with the duration of Mercedes' own current commitment to F1. Wolff has run the team with Lowe as his right-hand man since the departure of former team principal Ross Brawn at the end of 2013. In common with the rest of the teams, Mercedes will begin negotiations for beyond 2020 with new owner Liberty Media during this year. The deals conclude a busy winter of off-track activity for Mercedes, who have dominated the sport since the advent of turbo hybrid engines in 2014 with three consecutive world title doubles. A key factor in this success has been the combination of Toto's entrepreneurial skills and Niki's experience. The first 2017 car to be unveiled will be that of Swiss team Sauber on Monday, followed by the Renault on Tuesday, Force India on Wednesday and Ferrari, McLaren and Williams on Friday. Executive director (technical) Paddy Lowe is on gardening leave before his departure from Mercedes and is to join Williams in the coming weeks.

Google said it was working with regulators to ""explain its privacy policy changes"". Regulators in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Britain and the Netherlands have launched investigations into Google's privacy policies and, in January, France fined Google 150,000 euros (Â£117,000) for failure to comply with its privacy rules. The dispute has been running since March 2012 when Google consolidated its 60 privacy policies into one and started combining data from YouTube, Gmail and Google Maps. A spokesman for Google told the Reuters news agency that it was looking forward to discussing the new guidelines. Among other things, it says Google must tell users exactly what data is collected and with whom it is shared. It follows changes to the policy two years ago which regulators felt breached European rules. Users were given no means to opt out of the changes. ""These guidelines are doing nothing more than stating the obvious, and it is shameful that it took the Article 29 Working Party two years to come up with something that Google should already have been complying with,"" she said. Although Google has not been directly accused of acting illegally, it has been accused of providing ""incomplete and approximate"" details raising ""deep concerns about data protection and the respect of the European law"". ""It has made some changes but our investigation won't end until we believe it is fully compliant,"" said a spokesman for the UK's information commissioner's office (ICO).

""A photograph of a dirty restaurant kitchen is not rendered less newsworthy because the distributor intends to harass the restaurant owner."" Opponents of revenge porn legislation have argued that some of the new laws are too broad in scope, and that existing copyright, communication and harassment laws sufficiently cover the subject.

The MPAA, which represents six major Hollywood film studios, said the Minnesota law could ""limit the distribution of a wide array of mainstream, constitutionally protected material"". The MPAA called for the legislation to clarify that images shared without consent only broke the law if they were shared with an ""intent to harass"".

Mr Jones had been convicted based mostly on eyewitness evidence. Mr Jones said that he began to despair that he would ever be released from jail after repeated efforts to appeal against his 19-year conviction for a 1999 robbery. Mr Jones had been told by fellow inmates that he looked identical to Ricky. They argued that police identity procedures 17 years ago were deeply flawed. The researchers found that not only did the other man bear an uncanny resemblance to Mr Jones, he lived near the scene of the crime in Kansas City, Kansas, whereas Mr Jones lived across the state line in Kansas City, Missouri. Richard Anthony Jones from Kansas was released from jail after witnesses said they could not tell the two men apart. ""All my appeals had been denied. But in 2015 he told researchers from the Midwest Innocence Project - a group that aids wrongly convicted prisoners - about a man called Ricky he had heard about. While not saying Ricky was responsible, the judge found that based on the new evidence, no reasonable juror would have convicted Mr Jones. 'I don't believe in luck, I believe I was blessed,' Mr Jones told the Kansas City Star. Mr Jones told the Kansas City Star that he was now adjusting to life outside of jail and was happy to be back with his children. Lawyers for Mr Jones also said he was with his girlfriend and her family at the time members of the public were robbed in a park.

MSPs are to examine what long-term impact the 2014 Commonwealth Games has had in increasing participation and access to sport.

In May of this year, he wrapped his naked body in a ""cocoon"" of barbed wire outside the city's parliament. However, the 29-year-old now faces the charge of hooliganism. Pavlensky previously attracted attention by sewing his lips together in July of last year and demonstrating outside St Petersburg's Kazan Cathedral in support of the imprisoned Pussy Riot protesters. Critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin accuse the veteran leader of presiding over a crackdown on dissent since his re-election in March last year. The St Petersburg performance artist had reportedly sat for an hour and a half on the square on Sunday afternoon, with a nail driven through his genitals into the ground. It is the same charge used to jail members of the punk band Pussy Riot, and to prosecute activists from the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. Pavlensky was arrested but released the following day and placed under travel restrictions. starting with a fine and going up to a five-year prison sentence. Timing his act to coincide with Police Day, Pavlensky said in a statement published on Sunday: ""When the authorities turn the country into one big prison, openly robbing the populace and channelling funds to increase and enrich the police and other security agencies, society accepts arbitrariness and, having forgotten its advantage in numbers, brings the triumph of the police state closer through its inaction.""

One Italian ship rescued about 725 migrants from a single rubber boat, the coastguard said - just one of 20 rescue operations that day. With fewer migrants able to travel into Europe via Greece and the Balkan route, and France, Switzerland and Austria effectively closing their borders, Italy is struggling to deal with the growing numbers landing on its shores. They were among at least 28 migrants who died in the area on Tuesday, while some 4,655 people were rescued. The total number rescued over the past two days is more than 10,000, while the death toll is at least 50. The majority come from African countries, including Nigeria, Eritrea, Guinea, Gambia, Sudan, Ivory Coast and Somalia.

Bangladesh replied with 145-3 off 39.1 overs to win with 65 balls to spare, Sharmin Akhter top-scoring with 52. Having reached 106-4 with 19 overs remaining, Ireland looked set for a total approaching 200, however the innings faltered in the final third, as they slumped to 144 all out. Ireland must win their remaining two matches against Pakistan and South Africa to maintain qualification hopes. Ireland needed quick wickets in the Bangladesh chase, but their attack was blunted by a steady opening stand of 40 between Sharmin Sultana (22) and Sharmin Akhter. Clare Shillington and Laura Delany both made 37 as Ireland were bowled out for 144 after 47.1 overs of their innings. Meg Kendal returned from her hamstring injury to make 16, sharing in a third wicket stand of 45 with Shillington, who struck four boundaries and cleared the ropes twice in an entertaining 37 from 36 balls. After being put in to bat by Bangladesh at the Colombo Cricket Club, the Irish women were dealt an early blow as Cecilia Joyce (3) and Kim Garth (0) both went cheaply. Gaby Lewis (1-31) dismissed Sultana, and when Isobel Joyce ran out Islam for 2, Ireland were back in the contest at 52-2. Although Akhter was dismissed by Ciara Metcalfe (1-33), by that stage just 39 were needed, and Hoque (34 not out) in conjunction with Rumana Ahmed (24 not out) steered their side safely home. Ireland retained their one-day international status by making the Super Six, from which the top four qualify for the World Cup this summer. However Akhter hit a fine half century from 86 balls, adding 53 with Morgana Hoque, to ensure Bangladesh quickly regained control. Both fell in quick succession and it was left to skipper Delany and Isobel Joyce (24) to rebuild the innings with a stand of 44. Jahanara Alam (3-21), Panna Ghosh (2-16) and Khadija Tul Kubra (2-26) were best with the ball for Bangladesh.","Ireland are next in action when they face Pakistan on Friday, before taking on South Africa on Sunday.

""This is the most difficult kind of attack to track or predict,"" he told BBC Brasil. ""Brazil can be calm about such a possibility,"" the minister said. Last year, a leader of the Sao-Paulo-based criminal organisation, First Command of the Capital or PCC, was recorded issuing threats of kidnappings involving tourists and bomb attacks. The government is also deploying 1,850 members of the special forces and 36 helicopters as part of its counter terrorism unit. He said the federal government had asked local authorities to ensure local police officers used only a moderate amount of force. Speaking of potential protests, Mr Cardozo said the authorities would not tolerate violence committed by either demonstrators or the security forces. While terrorist attacks are considered unlikely, the authorities think demonstrations are a given. ""Demonstrations can occur, it is legitimate that they take place, but the Brazilian government is prepared to ensure abuses will not take place,"" he assured. National intelligence officials are reportedly also in contact with several international intelligence agencies. Mr Cardozo said that ""abuses of any kind would not be tolerated"". But their main focus has been on the possibility of an extremist bomb attack similar to that at the Boston marathon in 2013, officials say. The head of Brazil's counter terrorist task force Gen Julio Cesar de Arruda also thinks that the most likely terrorist attack scenario is that of a ""lone wolf"" or an extremist acting without connection to known terrorist groups. However, Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo says he considers such an attack unlikely. In Boston, two suspects not linked to extremist groups detonated two bombs killing three and injuring hundreds of people. The PCC said it would target the World Cup if its members were transferred to jails with higher security levels than the ones they are currently locked up in. Brazil's security forces have trained for several scenarios, including chemical and biological attacks. There will be more than 170,000 security personnel working on protecting the tournament in Brazil, including the police and the army. The authorities think that threat has gone away after the transfer was blocked by legal action.","At least seven different social movements have said they will protest around the time of the opening match on Thursday in several Brazilian cities.

It said the advertisement was intended to portray ""royalty, timeless beauty and elegance"" and expressed deep regret for any inadvertent hurt caused. After criticism, the company issued an apology on its Facebook page. ""The final layout of the ad is entirely the prerogative of the creative team for a brand,"" Ms Rai Bachchan's publicist said in a statement, suggesting that the actress had not been involved in the final image that appeared in the advertisement for Kalyan Jewellers. The advertisement shows a black, emaciated child holding a red parasol over the fair, bejewelled actress. A group of activists, in an ""open letter"" to Ms Rai Bachchan, called the image ""extremely objectionable"". The ad featuring the 41-year-old, who is a former Miss World, appeared in a newspaper last week. The activists said the image reminded them of ""17th and 18th century colonial European portraits of white aristocracy, depicting women being waited upon by their 'black servants'"" and called on the actress to dissociate herself from ""this offensive image"". The advertisement was also criticised on social media. The film star's publicist said she had been photographed without the backdrop. ""The extremely fair colour of your skin (as projected in the advertisement) contrasted with the black skin of the slave-boy is obviously a deliberate 'creative' juxtaposition by the advertising agency, and insidiously racist.""

But Sharp promotes the Igzo (Indium gallium zinc oxide) tech used in the displays as being more energy efficient than the silicon-based LCD screens commonly used in smartphones and tablets, which should help offset their power demands. Greek news site Techblog.gr - which was among the first to report the news - said that Sharp planned to put the displays into mass production next year, and expected Chinese manufacturers to be among its first customers.

""You will be able to show 4K content natively on the screen, which means you won't need to process it to get it to display properly.""

Camera-maker Red has just announced an 8K video camera, offering 16 times the resolution of 1080p HD. The Galaxy S6 offers 577ppi on a slightly smaller display. But experts say there is a limit to what the human eye can appreciate. 4K - which is also known as ultra-high definition - offers four times the resolution of 1080p HD. With smartphones becoming capable of filming in 4K, Mr Coulling also suggested there would be an energy trade-off that could benefit users watching back such videos.

The council previously warned the potential ""loophole"" could leave authorities worse off. But Peredur Jenkins, cabinet member responsible for resources, said the council had no power to stop owners from designating their properties as self-catering units. But self-catering units are classed as businesses and so their owners pay business tax to the Treasury rather than council tax. Mr Jenkins said Gwynedd was pressing the Welsh Government to consider changing the planning regulations to give local authorities the power to determine whether owners could re-classify their properties. Mr Humphreys, chairman of the council's corporate scrutiny committee, told the Post Cyntaf programme there was no mechanism for monitoring the situation. An estimated 23,000 homes in Wales are empty or used as second homes. Gwynedd council is a considering charging a premium on holiday homes. She said it was a ""a direct tax on people with second homes, many of whom already pay twice for services they rarely use"". Gwynedd said it was powerless to stop owners making the change. Councillor Jason Humphreys, however, fears the authority will lose out as people sidestep the charge by classing their second homes as self-catering businesses. Since 2006, the number of self-catering units in Gwynedd has risen from 78 to 968.

Current smokers say they do it principally to reduce the amount they smoke. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning But critics say there is no convincing evidence that e-cigarettes help people quit smoking and argue they could even encourage non-smokers to start. Some nine million still smoke in the UK despite a big rise in e-cigarette use. ""The rapid growth in e-cigarette use has come to an end,"" she said. But Ash said the message that vaping was much less harmful than smoking had not yet got through to all smokers. The main reason ex-smokers give for vaping is to help them stop smoking. Scientists say current evidence suggests that the risks of exposure to toxins for e-cigarette users are likely to be low - and much lower than with tobacco. This is because more than a third of smokers have still never tried e-cigarettes, as a result of concerns about the safety and addictiveness of e-cigarettes. Some 1.5 million vapers are ex-smokers, compared with 1.3 million who still use tobacco, a survey of 12,000 adults for Action on Smoking and Health found. People who combine electronic and standard cigarette smoking are still being exposed to the cancer-causing substances in tobacco smoke, increasing their risk of lung cancers, bronchitis and other diseases, although Public Health England believes levels of nicotine in e-cigarettes are unlikely to pose any significant health risk. ""It's very important smokers realise that vaping is much, much less harmful than smoking,"" she added. Deborah Arnott, the campaigning health charity's chief executive, said the figures on vapers who had quit smoking were ""excellent news"" but that the rate of people switching to electronic versions had peaked. In 2012, there were 700,000 vapers in the UK; now there are 2.9 million.

And earlier this month, police discovered 230 kilograms of liquid methylamphetamine in a consignment of 20,000 bottles of flavoured water destined for a Sydney warehouse. The ACC said there had been a ""considerable increase in the number and weight of detections at the Australian border"" without any decrease in domestic production. According to the report, gangs supplying the drug were also mixing other illegal substances into crystal meth in an attempt to increase addiction levels. The precursor chemicals used by Australia's domestic producers to ""cook"" the drug were being increasingly imported from India and China, it found. The ACC report recommended a ""collective national response"" to deal with the drug's increasing prevalence. ""Ice is a devastating, insidious drug. Chris Dawson, chief executive of the ACC, said the ""availability and addictive nature"" of crystal meth had ""created new demand in urban, rural and disadvantaged communities"". It affects everyone from users, their families, and their communities, and the authorities who deal with the users,"" he said. Methylamphetamine comes in a range of forms, with the crystal ""ice"" variety the most common in Australia. ""Everyone plays a role in the fight against illicit drugs - including governments, law enforcement, health, education, industry, non-government organisations and the community,"" Mr Dawson said. The price of crystal meth in Australia is among the highest in the world, the report found, driving the country's organised crime gangs to trade increasingly in the drug.

As Celtic manager Ronny Deila looked on in horror, things got worse for his side as Aberdeen roared further ahead. However, it was Aberdeen who should have gone further ahead. Celtic grew in confidence going forward during the first half, and there were strong claims for a penalty as Shay Logan was thought to have handled the ball. Deila's half-time response was to hand a debut to Colin Kazim-Richards at the expense of Stuart Armstrong. The contest then erupted and it was Aberdeen who decisively struck. Niall McGinn then fired from distance and Gordon cleared the ball as it looked to be heading just wide. Simon Church marked his debut with a goal when he bundled home from close range to make it 2-0 at Pittodrie. Celtic struggled to create until Scott Brown hooked the ball across for Griffiths, who looked certain to bury a header back across goal, but it inched past the far post. Hayes gathered a clearance about 25 yards from goal and hit a fabulous strike which crept inside goalkeeper Craig Gordon's post. Leigh Griffiths pulled one back in injury time, but the Dons held on to cut the gap on Celtic to three points. It was a sensational atmosphere in this top-of-the-table clash, which saw striker Church make his debut for the hosts with Efe Ambrose taking a seat on the bench. After a dominant start from the visitors, Aberdeen exploded into life when Jonny Hayes fired home an unstoppable drive from 25 yards. The early exchanges were combative and committed but restricted to long-range efforts that did not threaten an opener. Defensive indecision presented Church with a glorious chance to seal it, but he somehow screwed the ball wide from close range. McLean came close to a third just before half-time with a fierce drive from outside the box which Gordon diverted. Hayes sent in a corner, Kenny McLean nodded on and debutant Church kneed the ball home from close range to send Pittodrie wild.","Then Griffiths cut inside onto his left foot and fired past Scott Brown to pull one back for Celtic in stoppage time, but there was not enough time left to search for an equaliser.

Distorted perception may dominate in some people, leading to body image problems, a US journal reports. Susan Ringwood, chief executive of the eating disorders charity Beat, said: ""We know that one of the features of anorexia nervosa can be distorted body image. This revealed striking distortions - the volunteers tended to misjudge their hands as wider and their fingers as shorter than they actually were. The volunteers were asked to put their left hands palm down under a board and judge the location of the covered hand's knuckles and fingertips with a pointer. Scientists at University College London discovered people tend to think that their hands are wider and their fingers are shorter than they truly are. They say the confusion may lie in the way the brain receives information from different parts of the body. Lead researcher Dr Matthew Longo said: ""These findings may well be relevant to psychiatric conditions involving body image such as anorexia nervosa, as there may be a general bias towards perceiving the body to be wider than it is. ""They are able to judge other people's bodies quite accurately and would describe someone else the same size as themselves correctly, but still not be able to do that about their own weight and shape. ""This brain study may give some insight into how this could be possible, and could be very motivating for people with eating disorders to know that there was a biological explanation for their experiences, rather than feeling it was their fault.""

According to Hunter Davies's biography of The Beatles, one of Lennon's childhood treats was the garden party that took place each summer on the grounds of Strawberry Field. The original home in Woolton was demolished in the early 1970s and replaced with a smaller building. The plans were announced on the 50th anniversary of the release of the single, which was a double-A side with Penny Lane, reaching number two in the UK charts and number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the USA. The musician is said to have found a place of peace and refuge from his troubled childhood in the woods around the home, where he went to play with friends, climb trees and dream the hours away. The venture will combine an education centre for young people with learning difficulties and an exhibition on the home, the song and Lennon's early life.

Text found in attack data packets suggested it was mounted to protest against Mr Krebs' work to uncover who was behind a prolific DDoS attack. In a blogpost, Mr Krebs detailed the attack, which began late on Tuesday night and quickly ramped up to its peak attack rate. ""These new internet-accessible devices can bring great benefits, but they are also an increasingly easy and lucrative targets for cybercriminals,"" said Nick Shaw from security firm Symantec. Soon after the article was published, Israeli police arrested the two men named by Mr Krebs. ""It was among the biggest assaults the internet has ever witnessed,"" added Mr Krebs. The security firm has carried out research which shows swift growth in the number of malware families scouring the net for vulnerable devices. Released on bail, the pair were barred from using the net for 30 days. Mr Krebs speculated that the attack could have been prompted by an article he published, in early September, that named two young men allegedly associated with a service called vDos that carried out DDoS attacks for cash.

Economic data that suggested activity in the country's services sector expanded at its slowest pace in 17 months in December had little impact on investors' confidence. Monday's 7% plunge in the Shanghai market, which led to the suspension of trading for the first time, triggered a global equities rout. Traders in the rest of Asia were cautious after a North Korean nuclear test heightened geopolitical tensions. Beijing's decision on Tuesday to inject cash into the falling market also helped soothe fears. Local reports said the securities regulator would keep in effect its ban on share sales by major shareholders until new rules were released.

The row over the South Sudan peacekeeping mission erupted in December when the defence ministry said peacekeepers' logs for July, when the security situation there was worsening, had been discarded. But her months in the position have seen a series of gaffes. The 58-year-old Mrs Inada had already been widely expected to be replaced in a cabinet reshuffle next week that the prime minister hopes will help rebuild his ratings. He denies wrongdoing, but his approval ratings have fallen below 30% according to recent polls. But two months later officials said they had found the data on a computer, leading to allegations that the logs had been withheld on purpose. Tomomi Inada, a close ally of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, stepped down over an alleged cover-up of documents on a controversial peacekeeping deployment. Mrs Inada was appointed defence minister in 2016. Mr Abe apologised to the country on Friday immediately after Mrs Inada's resignation. He also said that for the time being, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida would add the defence portfolio to his duties. The prime minister is also facing plummeting support amid two patronage scandals. Japan is highly divided on the issue and claims the defence ministry has not been transparent over the South Sudan deployment will likely fuel public scepticism. On Thursday opposition leader Renho, who goes by one name, stepped down in order to take responsibility for the opposition's weakness.

She particularly came under fire for suggesting in a speech that the military wanted voters to back the ruling party. She was seen as an Abe protÃ©gÃ©, sharing his staunchly nationalist views.

On hearing the museum had been successful in raising funds to purchase the ring, Ms Clarkson said: ""The ring is a beautiful national treasure and I am happy to know that so many Jane Austen fans will get to see it at Jane Austen's House Museum."" She bought the turquoise and gold ring for £152,450 at auction last year, outbidding the Jane Austen's House Museum. Mr Vaizey added: ""It's clear from the number of people who gave generously to the campaign just how admired Jane Austen remains to this day."" It remained in the family until Clarkson bought it at auction. The ring is accompanied by papers documenting its history within the author's family. Austen, who lived most of her life in Hampshire, is one of English literature's most celebrated authors. After worldwide donations the museum has since raised enough money to buy the ring and its bid has been accepted. Culture minister Ed Vaizey put an export bar on it until 30 September. It passed first to her sister Cassandra, who then gave it to her sister-in-law Eleanor Austen on her engagement to Jane and Cassandra's brother, the Reverend Henry Thomas Austen. Contributions to the Bring the Ring Home campaign, set up by the museum in Jane Austen's former home, included an anonymous donation of £100,000 in August. Although out of copyright and available free on e-readers, it is estimated that Pride and Prejudice sells up to 50,000 copies each year in the UK. Mary Guyatt, curator of the museum, said it had been ""stunned by the generosity and light-footedness"" of those who had supported the bid. The museum said it hoped to welcome Ms Clarkson there in the future. The museum, in Chawton, Hampshire, was given until December to raise a further £49,000.

They showed a rise in the number of babies fed a mix of both breast and formula milk since 2005/06. Breastfeeding rates were also found to vary by geographical area in 2014/15. The statistics for last year also showed that by the time of the six to eight week health review the breasting rate had fallen to 38%. The World Health Organization recommends all children are exclusively breastfed up to six months, and breastfeeding alongside other appropriate foods continues up to and beyond two years. Reporting its key findings, the publication concluded: ""Across Scotland, the overall breastfeeding rate has remained at a broadly similar level over the last decade."" The figures have been published by ISD Scotland. Exclusive breastfeeding rates ranged from 24.3% in NHS Lanarkshire to 59.4% in NHS Shetland, for example. This rate included 35.2% of babies who were exclusively breastfed and 13.1% who were fed both breast and formula milk. But there has been an increase over the last decade in overall breastfeeding rates in the most deprived areas at the first visit from 26% to nearly 33%, the statistics showed. The report from ISD Scotland, which compiles health statistics for the government, looked at rates for babies born in the last financial year. In 2014/15 just over 48% of babies were being breastfed at the time of the first child health review visit at about 10 days old. It said breastfed infants were also likely to have a reduced risk of infection while other probable benefits included improved cognitive and psychological development, and a reduced risk of childhood obesity. This compares with the figures for a decade ago when 38.3% were exclusively breastfed and 6.4% were mixed fed. Earlier this year the Scottish government hosted a summit aimed at encouraging more mothers to breastfeed their babies. In 2014/15, 48.3% of babies were breastfed at the first visit review. Mothers in the least deprived areas were nearly three times as likely to breastfeed exclusively at six to eight weeks compared with mothers in the most deprived areas. In other findings, the report highlighted a ""clear association"" between low levels of breastfeeding and deprivation. Researchers also found that mothers who did not smoke were about three times more likely to breastfeed than smokers.","It said there is good evidence that breastfeeding in infancy has a protective effect against many childhood illnesses.

She has contested the decision at London's Appeal Court, which will make a ruling at a later date. Both were hit with a £31,000 legal costs bill. Angela Waring, of Crickhowell, Powys, was held jointly responsible by a judge in the noise nuisance complaint as she owned the home. The court heard their relationship was so strained Mrs Waring had been advised by police not to talk to her daughter following a harassment complaint. Mrs Waring paid for her daughter's cottage despite the pair having fallen out. Kim Eacott's terrier, Scally, had ""separation anxiety"" and would bark constantly at her Hereford cottage. The court heard Scally has since been put down. Catherine Doran, for the Cockings, said: ""Were it not for Mrs Waring's failure to abate the nuisance, Mr and Mrs Cocking would not have had to issue a claim at all."" Lady Justice Arden argued Mrs Waring had ""turned a blind eye"" to the problem. Hamish MacBean, for Mrs Waring, said she had done her best to defuse the row and wrote to her daughter, telling her: ""If Scally barks when you are not there, there is a dog whisperer in Abergavenny who can cure him in a gentle way."" Appeal Court judges reserved their decision until an unspecified future date. In Worcester County Court in 2013, judge Daniel Pearce-Higgins upheld the Cockings' noise nuisance claim. Miss Eacott was ordered to pay £3,500 in damages and her mother £1,000. Mrs Waring said she offered to take Scally to a ""dog whisperer"" to try to calm him down, despite not being on speaking terms with her daughter.","Mrs Waring has asked the court to rule that she was not responsible for her daughter, so should not have to pay for her failing to control Scally.

""And clearly there are pressures on a young girl not to do these things."" I think when you have teachers or other authority figures telling you that you can't do something, of course it creates huge anxiety. Academics, led by Dr Gijsbert Stoet, from Glasgow University's school of education, said it did not seem to matter whether the girls' mothers worked in related fields and that efforts to attract more women into science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects had largely failed. University of Glasgow researchers looked at achievements, attitudes and emotions around maths and found girls showed more negative emotion about it. Data was collected from 500,000 15-year-olds in 68 countries. Asked if maths had caused her anxiety at school, she said: ""Absolutely. So-called mathematics anxiety was found especially in countries which were more developed and where males and females were considered more or less equal.

227,35770030,"From 1981-89 she was one of the most influential first ladies in US history, initially criticised for an expensive renovation of the White House, but later becoming a much-loved figure. ""I see the first lady as another means to keep a president from becoming isolated,"" she once said. But this spending spree provoked an outcry from some outraged by what they saw as profligacy and waste while millions of Americans were losing their jobs. Like her husband, Mrs Reagan was a former Hollywood performer who made it all the way to the White House. The funeral takes place on Friday. As Nancy Davis, she was an actress during the 1940s and 1950s and married Mr Reagan, a prominent film actor, in 1952. After her husband died of Alzheimer's disease in 2004, she became a champion for Alzheimer's patients, raising millions of dollars for research and breaking with fellow conservative Republicans to argue for stem cell research. She served as first lady of California during her husband's stint as California governor from 1967 to 1975 before moving into the White House after his decisive victory over Democrat President Jimmy Carter in 1980. Mrs Reagan, who died of congestive heart failure in Los Angeles, was praised by President Barack Obama's family and other senior US politicians and foreign leaders. Her 52-year marriage to Ronald Reagan was once described as the US presidency's greatest love affair. Mrs Reagan's best-known project as first lady was the anti-drugs ""Just Say No"" campaign. Nancy Reagan died at the age of 94 last Sunday.

But Houston powered in a magnificent header in the first minute of injury-time to level. To their immense credit, Harps refused to give up and a clever Kevin McHugh ball released Michael Funston whose cross was brilliantly headed to the net by Houston from the edge of the penalty area in the first minute of injury-time. Nathan Boyle missed a glorious Derry chance with the last kick of the game.

""Tyler was one of the first pillars of our company,"" said Dennis. In a tribute to Alexander on the McLaren website, Dennis said: ""Tyler was one of the finest of the old school: hardy, humble and wise, leaving a reputation and a legacy that will remain indelible in the history of international motorsport."" Alexander was centrally involved at McLaren for more than 40 years after being recruited by driver Bruce McLaren to help set up the team in 1963. During his final 20 years with the company, McLaren won six drivers' and five constructors' world titles with Ayrton Senna, Mika Hakkinen and Lewis Hamilton. He returned to the US to join Mayer in running an Indycar team, which recruited as engineer a young Adrian Newey, now Red Bull's chief technical officer and the most decorated design engineer in F1 with world titles at Williams, McLaren and Red Bull. He left in 1983, two years after McLaren was taken over by current boss Ron Dennis, but returned in 1989 and worked there until he retired in 2008. Dennis took over McLaren in 1981, first running it alongside Mayer before taking total control, and two years later Alexander sold his shares to Dennis and left the company. Alexander and Mayer were the joint team principals of the short-lived US-based F1 team Beatrice in 1985 and 1986. The company continued under Mayer following McLaren's death in a testing crash in 1970. In the late 1960s, Alexander moved to run the company's successful programmes in the US, first in the CanAm sportscar championship and then in Indycar racing, before returning to F1 in 1979. In the early years of the team, Alexander worked alongside Bruce McLaren and fellow American Teddy Mayer in F1, first as chief mechanic and then chief engineer before becoming a director of the company.","Quite simply, Tyler lived and breathed McLaren.""

The date was set at a meeting in Irbil chaired by President Massoud Barzani. In April, senior Kurdish official Hoshyar Zebari told Reuters news agency that a ""yes"" vote would not necessarily mean independence would be declared. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have played a major role in the US-backed campaign against the jihadist group, which seized large parts of northern Iraq in 2014. It includes the city of Kirkuk and the towns of Makhmour, Khanaqin and Sinjar - locations where President Barzani's senior assistant Hemin Hawrami declared voting would take place in September. A statement said voting would take place in the three provinces that make up the region, and ""areas of Kurdistan outside the region's administration"". But while driving IS militants out of the country, the Peshmerga have taken control of disputed territory claimed by both Kurds and the central government. There was no immediate comment from Iraq's central government, but it has urged Kurds not to hold a referendum. Mr Zebari said it would merely help Kurds press their case for ""the best deal"" on self-determination once so-called Islamic State (IS) had been defeated in Iraq. ""The desire of our Kurdish brothers to create a country of their own is their right... and nobody has the right to deter them,"" he was quoted as saying by the Kurdish Rudaw news agency in April. Moves towards outright independence have historically been opposed by the governments of neighbouring Iran, Turkey and Syria, as well as by the US. ""But holding a referendum at this time is not right as the war [against IS] still rages, the region's situation is not suitable, and some neighbouring countries believe this move poses a threat to the nation's security themselves.""

During the eight years she worked on that programme, Ms Philbin was first to demonstrate many innovations including car navigation systems, fax machines and mobile phones. From there, she went on to work on the iconic BBC science show Tomorrow's World. Having once acted as a judge at the TeenTech Awards, I can testify to Maggie's inspirational qualities, both in showing young people that technology is about creativity as well as consumption, and in persuading companies to back her vision. Other technology figures recognised in the New Years Honours list include: More recently, Ms Philbin was a reporter on the BBC's Bang Goes The Theory science show, and has regularly appeared on other radio and TV programmes as an science expert. It's hard to think of anyone in the last 30 years who has had quite such an impact on enthusing people - and in particular young people - about technology as Maggie Philbin. In 2008, she helped to start the non-profit TeenTech organisation that aimed to give young people a realistic view of what it is like to work in jobs that have a high science, technology, engineering and mathematics component. She co-founded the TeenTech organisation, which holds events that introduce school children to technical and creative careers. Ms Philbin has been honoured for her work in sparking young peoples' interest in working in science, technology and engineering. Ms Philbin said giving children an insight into the ways that innovation and advances occur was important because an increasing proportion of jobs revolved around competence in science, technology and maths. It regularly runs events that let school children talk to people that work in different technical sectors and lets them get a feel for the techniques, equipment and approaches used in those professions. Ms Philbin has also had a long media career connected to science and tech.

""This is how Shakespeare was meant to be done,"" he added. ""He made an excellent entrance, but I'll have to teach him a few things about exits!"" said Rylance, winner of two Tony awards.

Stephen Fry, making his New York stage debut as Malvolio in Twelfth Night, was praised for his sympathetic portrayal of the usually malevolent character. Brantley said that the two productions were ""a source of radiant illumination for the audience, while the bewilderment of the characters onstage floods us with pure, tickling joy.

The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Myanmar says that despite the latest releases, the country's outdated legal system - administered by often vindictive local officials - is still jailing people for political activities, usually unauthorised protests. Presidential spokesman Zaw Htay said on Facebook that a total of 102 prisoners were being released. On Friday, an ethnic Kachin activist named Patrick Khun Jarli was jailed for six months for posting a picture online that mocked the military. It comes just over a week before the new parliament meets for the first time since last year's election victory by the opposition pro-democracy NLD party. Its most famous inmate was Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader whose party won the historic elections in November, ending decades of military or military-backed rule. Following complaints from monks, he was sentenced to two and a half years with hard labour for offending the Buddhist religion.

Under the plan, half the members of a new unity cabinet would belong to the ruling party, while 40% would be from the opposition party. The plan from the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) would see Mr Saleh quit within a month of signing the agreement and hand over to his vice-president. The other 10% would be from other political groups. The GCC previously offered Mr Saleh a proposal in which he was asked to stand down, but which did not outline a timetable. ""This speech is to raise spirits, but it's no longer logical because the people have had their say - they say an immediate departure is necessary,"" said Sultan al-Atwani, the leader of the Nasserist party, which is part of the opposition coalition. The revised plan also suggests Mr Saleh appoint an opposition leader to run a new cabinet that would prepare for presidential elections two months later. The proposal was rejected. At least 120 people have died in weeks of protests demanding the end of Mr Saleh's 32-year rule. But the opposition rejected the plan, saying they did not trust the government to keep to the conditions, and reiterated their demand for the president to leave immediately. In recent years it has struggled to confront an armed rebellion in the north and a secessionist movement in the south. Aides to Mr Saleh said he seemed poised to accept the initiative, according to Reuters news agency. The Yemeni leader, who has been in power for more than three decades, has said he is willing to hand over power but only to ""safe hands"".

Rights groups say more than a dozen media employees have been killed in Sri Lanka over the past decade. Last month, Sri Lanka was placed 162nd out of 179 in a Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. The BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo says Mr Shauketaly was on the phone to a colleague at the Sunday Leader on Friday evening at his home in Mount Lavinia when the call was cut. To date, too many incidents have had little investigation and no resolution,"" UK Foreign Office Minister Alastair Burt said in a statement. The Sunday Leader had long had a reputation for being outspokenly anti-government. Our correspondent says Mr Shauketaly had voiced fears that his investigative reporting might be putting him in danger, especially after strangers had called at his house recently asking for his whereabouts. A doctor who treated Mr Shauketaly said the journalist was now out of danger. Mr Shauketaly, 52, was taken to intensive care, where doctors pronounced him out of danger and have been working to remove a bullet. ""There has been a range of attacks in Sri Lanka on journalists, civil society organisations and others in recent years. None of the murders has been solved. Mr Shauketaly holds British and Sri Lankan passports and the UK government has called on the authorities to bring the attackers to justice. Shortly afterwards he answered a call and said he had been shot in the neck by three intruders, who had then escaped. Four years ago, the Sunday Leader's editor, Lasantha Wickrematunge, was shot dead by a group of masked men on motorbikes. A group of foreign lodgers at his house said he was covered in blood and calling for help. Its profile changed last year when it was bought by a well-connected businessman and retracted some of its articles, but it still does a considerable amount of investigative reporting. Sunday Leader's Faraz Shauketaly, who holds dual British and Sri Lankan citizenship, was rushed to hospital after being shot in the neck.","The case, which has never been solved, highlighted the dismal state of press freedom in the country, analysts said.

He said there was money within the reserves ""where the initial purpose has come to an end"" which is the cash which would be used to improve the area's economy. A Welsh government spokesman added: ""The Welsh ministers already have powers to set minimum level of reserves required to be held as part of the authority's budget setting process. Although plans have yet to be finalised, he said the intention was to spend about £20m of £72m earmarked reserves on an ""anti-austerity package"". Carmarthenshire's head of resources said he wanted to see the council's money spent in the authority area. ""Additionally, the provisions of the Local Government Act (Wales) prevent improper use of assets before mergers."" ""You can only spend money once. One council has told BBC Wales it intends using £20m of its cash before any reorganisation. ""Personally, I don't see mergers - so there's no need to prepare for that eventuality. The Welsh government said councils had to maintain reserves and it would act to halt ""irresponsible spending"". I don't think the Labour Party will get a majority in the next election so the proposed plans will not go ahead."" However, not every local authority agreed with Carmarthenshire's approach. ""This is common sense. But Carmarthenshire executive board member, councillor David Jenkins, said money should be spent on boosting the area's economy before any mergers.

272,32126847,"The fires come as a Royal Commission into Institutional Child Sexual Abuse travels around Australia taking evidence about alleged child sex abuse linked to churches, charities and government agencies. Local media have reported that in 1995 O'Donnell, aged 78, pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting 10 boys and two girls, aged between eight and 15, and spent 15 months in jail. Police would not comment on the fires or any suspects other than to say they were all suspicious and were being investigated separately. Local media have cited research by a Melbourne university that found at least five people had killed themselves after being sexually abused by Pickering between 1960 and 1980. The other two churches were linked to paedophile priest Ronald Dennis Pickering, who served at various parishes in Melbourne between 1958 and 1993, before returning to his native Britain where he died in 2009. The Dandenong church was one of eight Catholic churches linked to priest Kevin O'Donnell, who sexually abused children throughout his 50-year career in Melbourne parishes. On Monday fire almost destroyed the 123-year-old St James Church in Brighton, while a separate fire damaged St Mary's Church in St Kilda East. Hollywood actress and former St James' parishioner Rachel Griffiths said the church's destruction came as a relief because of its history. But Regional Bishop for the Catholic Church in Victoria Peter Elliott told Fairfax Radio he did not believe the fires were linked to anger over child sexual abuse, but were instead the work of a ""very disturbed person"". ""I was quite elated, like many of my generation, when I heard the news,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""It's always been a difficult building for us to drive past because there's been so much tragedy and complicated feelings, I guess,"" she said. St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong is the latest to suffer from what police are calling a suspicious fire. He was freed in 1996 and died in 1997. In 2013, both men were on a list released by the Australian Catholic Church of 29 Melbourne priests who it acknowledged were guilty of sexually abusing children. The blaze started in the early hours of Tuesday, causing extensive damage.","The fires come as a Royal Commission into Institutional Child Sexual Abuse travels around Australia taking evidence about alleged child sex abuse linked to churches, charities and government agencies.
