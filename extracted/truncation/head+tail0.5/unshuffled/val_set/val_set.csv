0,39953806,"Michael Bryn Jones, 39, from Llandudno, disappeared on 3 April 2016 after going to the door of the Hergest psychiatric unit at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor. He was found hanging in woodland on 21 June. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) said it has already changed its procedures. An inquest into Mr Jones' death heard he had been a patient at the Hergest unit until a few days before his disappearance and continued to suffer anxiety and paranoia after he left hospital. He turned up at the unit in the early hours of 3 April and was sent to the accident and emergency department but left without booking in or speaking to anyone. Robat Hughes, the senior nurse who spoke to Mr Jones at the unit, told the inquest he regretted not asking him whether he was already having treatment. ""He came to the door and asked to see a doctor, but I said there was no doctor there as she'd gone home sick. I said that if he went to accident and emergency then there were doctors there,"" he said. ""He was relaxed and calm. I didn't know if he was using mental health services and I didn't ask. ""I should have asked if he'd been having treatment. It has been something I've thought about a lot since."" Dr Stuart Porter, a consultant psychiatrist who reviewed the incident, said: ""Somebody should have taken Michael Bryn Jones to accident and emergency. It's also good practice to follow that up with a phone call."" In a statement, BCUHB said it offered ""sincere condolences"" to Mr Jones' family and ""fully accepted"" the coroner's findings. ""We have carried out our own thorough investigation, in conjunction with Michael's family, and as a result we have made changes to service provision,"" it added. Recording a conclusion of suicide, coroner Nicola Jones said: ""There should have been more effort to persuade [Mr Jones] to come into the Hergest unit for a full assessment of his condition.

The controversial politician had previously appeared supportive of LGBTQ rights, saying in 2015 that same-sex marriage was ""good"". But he is otherwise known for his conservative views especially on crime. He has waged a much-criticised war on drug users and dealers leading to thousands of extra-judicial killings. His latest remarks were made on Sunday night to Filipino expatriates in the Burmese capital of Nay Pyi Taw while on an official trip to Myanmar. A transcript of the speech was only given to journalists on Monday. In a meandering speech addressing criticism of his now-suspended war on drugs, Mr Duterte accused the West of imposing its values on the Philippines, then referred to a recent Time magazine story on the transgender community in the US. ""There is no gender because you can be a he or she... That's their culture. It does not apply to us. We are Catholics and there is the Civil Code, which says that you can only marry a woman for me... a woman to marry a man. ""That's our law so why would you accept that gender?"" he said. ""Wherever God placed you, just remain there. Do not mix it upâ€¦ You erase the great divide between a woman and a man,"" he added. Before becoming president in June 2016, Mr Duterte was the mayor of Davao city, which introduced anti-discrimination laws for sex, gender and sexual orientation during his administration. In 2015, Mr Duterte appeared on a national talk show where he said same-sex marriage was ""good... everyone deserves to be happy"". The following year, while campaigning for the presidency, he said he would ""consider"" legalising same-sex marriage if there was such a proposal. The Philippines has 80 million Catholics and remains a deeply religious society. Mr Duterte has taken issue with the church previously, once calling the Pope a ""son of a whore"". Despite his many controversial comments he still remains highly popular in the Philippines.","Mr Duterte clarified that he had ""nothing against gays"", saying several of his relatives were homosexual.

Kidman said while she doesn't have to work, she does so because of her passion for cinema. The star of The Killing of the Sacred Deer, in competition at Cannes, said her young children will be banned from seeing the dark psychological thriller. Kidman has two grown-up children from her marriage to Tom Cruise and two younger daughters with her current husband singer Keith Urban.

She added: ""I'm at that stage in my life where I still try to act as if I'm 21 and starting my career. ""At this stage of my life, I'm just trying to stay very bold and open and try things and support film-makers I believe in."" The Killing of the Sacred Deer features an eminent surgeon Steven Murphy - played by Colin Farrell - who adopts a teenager into his family. Things start to go horribly wrong when the boy turns against Murphy. Kidman plays ophthalmologist Anna Murphy, who is married to Steven. It's directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek filmmaker behind indie hit The Lobster, which won the Jury Prize at Cannes two years ago. Farrell also starred in that film. Kidman said she was ""hypnotised"" by Lanthimos' script. She has four projects showing at the festival this year, but said: ""That's a confluence of events - that's not something I was aware would be happening."" Her other Cannes showings are in The Beguiled and How to Talk to Girls at Parties, as well as the second series of TV drama Top of the Lake, from Jane Campion.

3,17777517,"Spanish Trade Secretary Jaime Garcia Legaz said the EU would intervene over Argentina's seizure of the controlling stake in YPF from Spanish firm Repsol. Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also offered support. But Argentine officials said they were not worried by possible reprisals over the nationalisation. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced the measure on Monday, saying she was asserting sovereignty over Argentina's energy resources. Her government is taking 51% of YPF, wiping out Repsol's 57.4% majority stake. The move has wide support in Argentina but has provoked outrage in Spain, which has threatened reprisals. The Spanish government will consider what measures to take at a cabinet meeting on Friday, and has also been rallying international support. ""There are going to be very clear interventions on the part of the European Union,"" Trade Secretary Jaime Garcia Legaz said, without revealing further details. It is not clear what any reprisals might involve. EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said Spain would also raise the issue with the IMF, the World Bank and the G-20. ""We will try to pressurise Argentina so that it sees that this road is going nowhere,"" he said after meeting Hillary Clinton. He added that Spain and the US had agreed to work together to ""re-establish international legality"". But the Argentine government says it will not back down in its decision to nationalise YPF, which it says is a lawful action taken in the national interest. ""The government takes its decisions thinking about the Argentine people and not what the US or the Spanish government think,"" Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo said. ""We are not worried about any kind of reprisals,"" he added. Repsol has said it wants around $10bn for its stake in YPF, but Argentina has said it does not accept that valuation. It says YPF did not invest enough to increase output from its oil fields, forcing Argentina to rely on imports. YPF, Argentina's biggest oil company, was privatised in 1993. Last year it announced huge new finds of shale oil and gas.","Spanish Trade Secretary Jaime Garcia Legaz said the EU would intervene over Argentina's seizure of the controlling stake in YPF from Spanish firm Repsol.

Coroner Nicola Jones recorded a narrative verdict, saying it was impossible to say for certain whether Mr Lewis' death was an accident or suicide. The inquest in Caernarfon previously heard that Mr Lewis, a paranoid schizophrenic, had been sectioned at the hospital's Hergest unit for an alleged assault on his mother, who cared for him. He was later moved to the Cynan ward, where the day before his death he was refused extra medication for feeling agitated. A police officer also visited the ward a few days earlier to speak to Mr Lewis about his bail arrangements, a visit which consultant psychiatrist Dr Olufemi Adebajo told the inquest he was ""extremely unhappy"" about. After the hearing, North Wales Police said the officer had acted ""perfectly reasonably"". Supt Nigel Harrison confirmed Mr Lewis had previous contact with the police and an officer did visit him in hospital to undertake a ""legal requirement"" and ""having sought permission to do so"". He said: ""As part of our multi agency work with our partner agencies, we regularly hold meetings with the local health board, where the now raised concerns by the consultant will be discussed.

The NCA becomes fully operational in 2013 when it takes over from the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Its expanded role will include powers to order police forces to run operations into drugs and trafficking. As well as replacing the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), the new agency will take in the work of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), and also house the national cyber crime unit. It will also cover border policing and economic crime. ""For too long we have lacked a strong, collaborative national response in the fight for criminal justice.

Mr Bristow said he would work with the government and other crime agencies ""to ensure that the NCA delivers the maximum protection possible for communities within the resources it has available"".

But, according to Times Higher Education, an ""offshore King's College Europe"" is now on the cards. King's College confirmed that it was discussing potential further collaborations with TU Dresden. The two institutions already offer 10 joint professorships and several joint PhD programmes through Transcampus. However, its dean, Prof Stefan Bornstein, has told Times Higher Education that plans for the new King's campus are already ""in the process"". Prof Bornstein, who is director and chairman of TU Dresden's department of medicine and an honorary consultant in diabetes and endocrinology at King's, said the plan would allow King's to have a presence in Europe and maintain access to European research funding post-Brexit. Likewise, he said, TU Dresden would benefit from increased ties to London, one of the ""leading academic centres in the world"". Prof Bornstein said the new campus would hopefully run new undergraduate courses ""linked to innovation and the needs of industry and society"". The aim would be to recruit leading scholars from around the world, he added. Prof Bornstein said the Transcampus project had been envisaged before the EU referendum but admitted that it had become ""a lot more interesting"" since the vote. ""We cannot allow things that have developed for so many years in a positive way [to be] hampered by political decisions that actually nobody wanted,"" he said.

12,35052404,"It had been thought that being unhappy was bad for health - particularly for the heart. But the decade-long analysis, published in the Lancet, said previous studies had just confused cause and effect. However, experts argued that unhappiness in childhood may still have a lasting impact. A series of studies had shown that how happy people are, strongly predicts how long they are going to live. Ideas included detrimental changes in stress hormones or the immune system resulting in a higher risk of death. But the research team in the UK and Australia said those studies failed to deal with reverse causality - namely, that people who are ill are not very happy. Participants in the Million Women Study were asked to regularly rate their health, happiness and levels of stress. The results showed that whether people were ""never"", ""usually"" or ""mostly"" happy had no impact on their odds of dying during the duration of the study once other factors such as health or whether they smoked were taken into account. Dr Bette Liu, one of the researchers at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: ""Illness makes you unhappy, but unhappiness itself doesn't make you ill. ""We found no direct effect of unhappiness or stress on mortality, even in a 10-year study of a million women."" Co-author Prof Sir Richard Peto, from the University of Oxford, said light smokers had double the risk of an early death and regular smokers had three times the risk of dying during the study period, but that happiness was ""irrelevant"". He said it could have indirect effects if people started consuming large amounts of alcohol or massively overeating, but happiness itself ""does not have any material, direct, effect on mortality"". But he warned the myth may be too entrenched to shake off: ""People will still believe stress causes heart attacks after this story has been and gone. ""It isn't true, but it suits people to believe it."" In a commentary, Dr Philipe de Souto Barreto and professor Yves Rolland from the University Hospital of Toulouse in France, said: ""Further research from a lifecourse perspective is needed since happiness during critical periods, such as childhood, could have important consequences on health in adulthood.""","It had been thought that being unhappy was bad for health - particularly for the heart.

13,37385942,"Fighting that broke out in the capital, Juba, in July is responsible for the latest surge in those fleeing, it says. More than 1.6 million people are also displaced within South Sudan, meaning about 20% of the population have been made homeless since December 2013. A fragile peace deal signed last year is on the brink of collapse. ""The violence in July came as a major setback to peace efforts in South Sudan,"" the UNHCR spokesman Leo Dobbs said in a statement. The UN says more than 185,000 people have fled South Sudan since July. ""The fighting has shattered hopes for a real breakthrough and triggered new waves of displacement and suffering, while humanitarian organisations are finding it very difficult for logistical, security and funding reasons to provide urgent protection and assistance to the hundreds of thousands in need,"" Mr Dobbs said. South Sudan refugees: Many of the refugees arriving in Uganda, which hosts the most South Sudanese, are ""exhausted after days walking in the bush and going without food or water. Many children have lost one or both of their parents"", the UNHCR says. A fall-out between President Salva Kiir and former Vice-President Machar - the most powerful members of their respective Dinka and Nuer ethnic groups - led to the civil war which erupted in December 2013. They only agreed to settle their differences under intense international pressure, signing a peace deal in August 2015 - and Mr Machar returned to Juba as vice-president in a unity government in April. But battles then broke out between his bodyguards and presidential guards three months later, prompting him to flee. Another member of his party has been appointed as vice-president, a move Mr Machar does not recognise. Earlier this week, a report funded by George Clooney accused both Mr Kiir and Mr Machar, as well as their officials, of personally profiting from the war. Both men have denied the allegations. The UN wants to deploy a 4,000-strong regional protection force for Juba which would have a more robust mandate than the 12,000 UN soldiers already in the country, however the mandate and size of the force still have to be agreed.

It wants Italy to destroy infected trees and restrict any trade in species vulnerable to the disease. New emergency measures are to be proposed by the Commission this week. Thousands of hectares of olives are affected by the outbreak - a major worry for Italy, which is the EU's second biggest olive oil producer after Spain. The Commission set out a range of measures to contain the outbreak last July, but says the situation has deteriorated since then and more action is needed. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) says the disease, which kills trees by desiccation, is spread by various sap-sucking insects. An EFSA spokesperson told the BBC that there remain ""a lot of uncertainties"" about the Italian outbreak, despite a comprehensive EFSA study of it published in January. ""Even trees not showing symptoms might carry the bacteria, which makes it really difficult. Just cutting down trees with symptoms might not be enough,"" he said. Italian officials in Lecce say 15km-wide (nine-mile) buffer strips will be created around plantations which have infected trees. Those strips should be free of species vulnerable to the disease, so that the blight is contained. Local officials, quoted by Italy's AGI news agency, suspect the disease entered Italy through ornamental plants imported from Costa Rica. The Xylella blight has previously ravaged vineyards in California and citrus groves in Brazil, EFSA says. A local campaign group called Peacelink disputes the EU data on the disease, however, arguing that a fungal infection is most likely to blame. In a letter to EU Health and Food Safety Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis, Peacelink says more than 500 olive trees treated for fungi have recovered since spring last year. It says research by the University of Foggia pointed to fungi, rather than Xylella, as the cause.

""I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right."" One Direction will continue their world tour as a four piece and record a fifth album later this year. Last week, Malik walked away from the band's world tour after being signed off with stress. He returned to the UK shortly after being forced to defend his relationship with his fiancee, Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards. A photo had earlier emerged of him holding another woman around the waist. A second photo, taken from behind, showed Malik standing close to the woman. Their hands and arms looked as though they were linked. In a statement, the rest of the group said: ""We're really sad to see Zayn go, but we totally respect his decision and send him all our love for the future. ""The past five years have been beyond amazing - we've gone through so much together, so we will always be friends. ""The four of us will now continue. We're looking forward to recording the new album and seeing all the fans on the next stage of the world tour.""

""They are going to get £3.5m and they're selling him on the cheap. And that tells me where the club is going: nowhere,"" said Giles. Marshall agreed personal terms with Hull after being omitted from Saturday's Championship defeat by Reading. The 31-year-old has made more than 280 appearances for Cardiff since arriving from Norwich City for free in 2009. Cardiff are 17th in the 24-strong division with one win, two draws and two defeats. Marshall is widely regarded as their star player and Giles, who had two playing stints with the club lasting a combined total of six years, is unhappy at the player leaving. ""I think it's a joke.

""Football today, I hate it, all these stats - they keep going on with stats, but if you look at Marshall's stats, they would without a doubt be better than anyone in the Championship and be a lot better than goalkeepers in the Premier League and they've let him go.

24,33086002,"The company said that Kensington and Chelsea had seen prices plummet by 16% since a peak in September 2014. In Westminster it claimed there had been a fall of 22% between a peak in November and the end of May. It blamed the fall on the new stamp duty regime, introduced in December, which penalises expensive properties. Based on average prices, anyone buying a property in Kensington and Chelsea can now expect to pay more than Â£118,000 in stamp duty alone. ""This fall-off in the top tiers of the market has cooled activity levels too,"" said Adrian Gill, director of Reed Rains and Your Move estate agents, part of the LSL group. He said the number of homes being sold in London as a whole had dropped by 16% in the year to April. A wider survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) reported that the stock of houses per surveyor has fallen to its lowest level for at least 37 years. However, prices in the London suburbs - and other parts of England and Wales - continued to hit new highs, said LSL. According to its calculations, prices rose by 4.5% in the year to May, making the average cost of a home Â£277,178. That is similar to estimates by the Office for National Statistics, but much higher than figures from Halifax and Nationwide. Buyers of properties worth less than Â£937,000 now pay less in stamp duty than they used to. Prices in England's smallest county - Rutland - rose by 23.8% over the year, while those in the Welsh county of Carmarthenshire went up by 16.4%. Thirteen outer London boroughs saw prices hit new highs. Previous figures from the Land Registry have suggested that prices in the suburbs across England and Wales have been taking off, including in parts of Manchester. The separate RICS survey suggests prices in England and Wales could rise by as much as 25% over the next five years, due to the shortage of housing stock. It said that, away from the South East, the strongest growth was expected in north-west England, as a result of the government's northern powerhouse initiative. LSL's house price index is based on statistics released by the Land Registry, so includes cash sales.","The company said that Kensington and Chelsea had seen prices plummet by 16% since a peak in September 2014.

It is believed that Manchester United and England striker Rooney's uncle Richie, 54, was also among those detained.

""I didn't notice anything interesting until I went through the footage later and saw this grassy rooftop."" Mr Li, who was raised in the US but has family in Hong Kong, then posted the picture on Facebook hoping one of his friends would know the couple. From then, it ""kinda just took off"", he says. The shot, which he believes shows the roof of the J residence apartments in Hong Kong, was definitely not staged, says Mr Li. ""So many people think that I staged the photo,"" he says. ""I'm a filmmaker not a wedding photographer so I don't really have an incentive. It's really just a lucky catch."" But he did make some adjustments to the original photo, which was taken on 28 September. The photo he captured shows two people standing near the couple's feet, presumably photographers, who Mr Li airbrushed out to make the couple stand out more. A person sprawled out on some seating in the corner, however, was spared the cut. Mr Li says he applied some colour correction to the image as well. For now, the identity of the couple - who might in real life not actually be a couple - remains a mystery, though Mr Li has made enquiries with the building's management who have yet to respond. But even if the photo fails to make it into the wedding books, he thinks it's a great metaphor for life in Hong Kong.

Olivia Marks-Woldman, chief executive of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, which commissioned the questionnaire, said: ""The theme for the thousands of Holocaust Memorial Day events taking place across the country today is 'Don't stand by', and these figures show just how important that message is. ""Today is about remembering the atrocities of the Holocaust and subsequent genocides, but it's also about finding ways to make sure they can never happen again.

It is the first time the disease has been found in the species and little is known about the spread of the potentially fatal disease. Conservationists, however, say there are other more significant threats to red squirrels such as squirrelpox. Scientists are urging the public to report sightings of squirrels which may be suffering from leprosy. They said the information would help them build up a more detailed understanding of the disease. There is no suggestion of any risk to human health. Infected animals have been found from Dumfries and Galloway to the Moray Firth. Symptoms include hair loss and severe swelling to the snout, eyelids, ears and feet. Prof Anna Meredith of the Royal Dick School of Veterinary Studies at Edinburgh University is leading the research. She told BBC Scotland: ""We suspect this disease is more widespread than the six cases we have confirmed. ""Red squirrels are in decline. They are threatened by the grey squirrel and already face the major threat of the squirrelpox virus. ""This is the last thing that they need - another disease which could potentially threaten the population."" However conservationists from Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels said the leprosy infection appeared to be extremely rare and would not be a major threat to the wider population. Project manager for Mel Tonkin, said : ""Much more of a threat is the squirrelpox virus which is virtually always fatal to red squirrels, but finds a reservoir in grey squirrels. ""Research indicates that squirrelpox disease is responsible for accelerating the rate with which grey squirrels have replaced red squirrels throughout most of England and Wales. ""However, the conservation community has shown that red squirrel populations can be protected in the midst of grey squirrels carrying the virus by keeping the grey squirrel population density at a very low level."" Researchers in Edinburgh investigating the leprosy infection said dead red squirrels could be sent to them by post provided they were appropriately packaged.

In 2010, journalist Sarah Vine, the wife of the then education secretary Michael Gove, wrote that while her husband could travel home by public transport, his red box would travel separately ""in air-conditioned splendour, snug and secure in the back of a locked car"". The red boxes travelled alone using the Government Car Service 1,910 times between 2012-13 and 2014-15, with the number of journeys rising over the course of the three years. 2011-12 £110,865 2012-13 £65,447.70 2013-14 £56,581.28 2014-15 £79,426.23 2015-16 £41,520.58 Source: Freedom of Information request to the Department for Transport Since 2012, pool cars have also been used by departments but their use is not recorded by the DfT, the department said. Labour MP Graham Jones told the Huffington Post: ""The Tories said they'd clamp down on wasteful spending yet they still allow hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money to be spent ferrying round briefcases in chauffeur-driven cars."" But the Department for Transport said the total cost of carrying ministers' paperwork was just 5% of the total spent on the Government Car Service‎ and that it was committed to ensuring the service provided value for money. A spokeswoman added: ""That is why, since 2010, the number of cars that make up the service has been reduced from 227 to 78. ""We have also been working hard to cut our operating costs in order to further reduce the cost to the public purse. ""Before April 2012, all cars were part of a government car pool and could be booked separately by ministers.

Mr Javid said he had been concerned at talk of a time-frame for the sale of three to four weeks, but says there is now an understanding it is ""much longer"" than that. Ms Hart told the BBC: ""It's very important to recognise in UK terms we can't allow the steel industry to go. ""What happens to defence contracts, what happens now in terms of nuclear?

The board also voted on a review of its policies and corporate culture by former US Attorney General Eric Holder. The review was instigated in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler made claims of sexual harassment. Uber confirmed to the BBC that ""the board unanimously voted to adopt all the recommendations of the Holder Report. The recommendations will be released to the employees on Tuesday."" It has not been confirmed what those recommendations are. It is possible that Mr Kalanick could take time off from Uber and then return to a role with less authority, or remain as chief executive but face more scrutiny, the Reuters news agency reported. The New York Times reported that one of Mr Holder's recommendations was that Emil Michael, Uber's senior vice-president of business and a close confidant of Mr Kalanick, should leave the company. The board meeting comes just days after Uber said it had fired more than 20 people, and was taking other actions against staff, for issues including sexual harassment and bullying. If Mr Michael does leave it would be the latest high-profile departure from Uber. Last week Uber's finance chief, Gautam Gupta, said he was leaving, following New York general manager, Josh Mohrer, and the head of Uber's self-driving unit, Anthony Levandowski, out of the door. Mr Kalanick has earned a reputation as an abrasive leader and was criticised earlier this year after being caught on video berating an Uber driver. He said in response to the video: ""I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up."" Uber board member Arianna Huffington said in March that Mr Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a ""scrappy entrepreneur"" to be more like a ""leader of a major global company"".

Countries are working towards options to limit greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 ahead of a crunch December summit. But the UN said progress had been made in streamlining the text of a new agreement. The climate talks in Bonn are designed to pave the way towards the signing of a new deal in Paris at the end of the year that will shape the world's actions over climate change for decades to come. On Wednesday, Christian Aid said there was a danger of ''sleepwalking into Paris''. ''There has been too much time spent fiddling around with the unimportant details of the text,'' said the charity's senior climate change adviser, Mohamed Adow. ''Negotiators have acted like schoolchildren colouring in their homework timetable and not getting round to any actual homework.'' He said negotiations must deliver ''a robust text soon otherwise they will cause further unacceptable delays and result in countries sleepwalking into Paris''. Momentum is building towards the UN climate summit in Paris. Key sticking points include finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change and agreeing on immediate and binding targets for carbon emissions. But negotiating time is running out with only around 10 days' worth of negotiations remaining after the Bonn talks close. On Wednesday, countries discussed new draft text for the agreement designed to boost climate action in the short term. A network of NGOs known as the Climate Action Network said there were ''solid suggestions for delivering near-term action that will be up for decision in Paris''. ''Parties have moved forwards to consolidate the draft Paris text here in Bonn, this will help give ministers more clarity and enable them to provide political steer on crunch issues over the coming months,'' said Jake Schmidt of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Delegates will return to Bonn in August and October for another two rounds of climate talks, before the summit in Paris at the end of the year. Scientists say ambitious action is needed to avert the most severe impacts of climate change. So far, more than 30 countries have pledged to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, with around 150 smaller countries yet to set goals.

""As a piece of real estate, it's extremely profitable to be targeted by malware writers.""

The system can also detect unknown dangerous URLs by assessing threats in real-time. This means harmful URLs can be blocked even before they are known to the company - cutting off a key tactic used by phishers in which constantly changing URLs fool database-driven protection. In addition, the system will ""follow"" links made using popular URL shorteners - such as bit.ly and ow.ly - to verify their safety.

Myrna Arias alleges that she was ""scolded"" for removing the app and fired a few weeks later. The company has not responded to the allegations. According to court documents published by website Ars Technica, employees were instructed to download the app, called Xora, to their phones in April 2014. Xora is described on its website as a workplace management app which allows companies to ""remotely manage"" their workers by keeping track of their hours and other aspects of their job. Xora's website says that the app uses GPS to allow bosses ""to see the location of every mobile worker on a Google Map"". According to the lawsuit, Ms Arias's manager ""admitted that employees would be monitored while off-duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments ever since she had installed the app on her phone"". ""He confirmed that she was required to keep her phone's power on 24/7 to answer phone calls from clients,"" reads the court document. It goes on to detail that Ms Arias had ""no objection"" to being monitored at work but felt that monitoring her location during non-work hours was an invasion of her privacy. She likened the app to a prisoner's ankle bracelet. Her boss ""scolded the plaintiff when she de-installed the app in late April in order to protect her privacy"", reads the court document. She was fired on 5 May. Ms Arias is seeking damages for lost earnings in excess of $500,000.

""This is something he cares very deeply about, and if there's a way he can help, of course he would be willing to,"" she told the BBC's Sunday News. Northern Ireland's political parties have been holding round-table talks. It follows a row sparked by a police assessment that IRA members were involved in murdering a former IRA man. In the wake of the killing of Kevin McGuigan Sr, police said the IRA still existed, but added that it was not engaged in terrorism. Three Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) ministers subsequently resigned from Northern Ireland's ruling executive, and Peter Robinson, the party's leader, stepped aside as first minister. Mr Clinton's offer of assistance was made public on Saturday by Irish prime minister Enda Kenny, who met him last week in New York. Ms Soderberg said the ultimate responsibility for achieving progress lay with the Northern Ireland parties. In an Irish Times article last year, she accused Northern Ireland politicians of an ""abysmal abdication of leadership"" and being ""stuck in the past"". Asked if this was still her view, she said: ""The fact that you need to call back Bill Clinton to move things forward is evidence that this remains true. ""That's not to say that this is easy - I don't mean to sit over here on this side of the pond and just throw darts, but after all that Washington has invested in this, as well as London and Dublin, the fact that they're still questioning whether you can have a devolved government is quite stunning.""

The incentive - financial bonuses for good marks. Here are five more notorious examples of exam cheating. Red faces all round when allegations emerged in January that 34 US Air Force officers in charge of launching US nuclear missiles had cheated in proficiency tests. According to the US Air Force, some staff had sent answers by text message to others at the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was a monthly test that all those dealing with nuclear missiles in the US must take. Other officers were accused of knowing about the cheating but failing to do anything about it. In Shaanxi province, 2,440 pharmacists were accused of cheating in a national licensing test according to China's state TV. The scam involved the use of earpieces last October. Fake candidates were sent into exams to get hold of the questions, the South China Morning Post reports. They then left the test centres early to find out the answers. Candidates who had paid the scammers the appropriate fee then received the correct answers through their earpieces. Several hundred people have been arrested in connection with mass school exam cheating in the Indian state of Bihar. Parents climbing school walls to pass the answers though windows may not be the most subtle method, but it's by no means the only one. Many students smuggled in textbooks and notes into the examination centres despite tight security.

Up to 64 were suspended for cheating in January, the Boston Globe reported. At issue were electronic hand-held clickers registered to individual students to answer questions in class. Some of these apparently fell into the wrong hands, enabling students to cheat. Some face a one-term suspension, the college says. Money seems to have been central to this one, according to the Cuban authorities. Eight people, five of them teachers, were arrested last year accused of selling university entrance exams.

44,29610570,"Dr Kate Parkins said, in the last 18 months, another five children in Greater Manchester have also suffered life-changing injuries as a result. She said the button-shaped batteries ""look like sweets"" to children but can cause severe internal bleeding which medics struggle to treat. Lithium batteries are found in items such as toys, keys and smartphones. Dr Parkins, a lead consultant for the region's Paediatric Intensive Care Transport Service, is calling for a national campaign to highlight the dangers. ""They look innocent enough and therefore nobody thinks to put them out of reach from children,"" she said. One child died in May last year after a battery got lodged in the upper part of the feeding tube, she said. ""It had been removed and then, about a week later, caused catastrophic bleeding which we couldn't control."" The most serious cases are associated with Lithium button batteries larger than 20mm (the size of a 10 pence piece) which can cause severe injury within two hours. And they do not have to be damaged, crushed or chewed to cause serious harm. ""It's not what's inside the battery,"" she explained. ""The battery sets up an electrical current which causes a build-up of sodium hydroxide which is caustic soda. ""That causes a burn through the oesophagus, the feeding tube, and that can then burn through into major blood vessels and that's why the bleeding is then pretty much impossible to control and stop."" The consultant at Central Manchester University Hospital Trust also wants to raise medical awareness ""because a lot of doctors are unaware that this can cause harm either"". Dr Parkins said in the second fatal case, medics did not know if the three-year-old had swallowed a button battery. ""She suffered catastrophic bleeding which again with all medical intervention we couldn't control. ""She died because of severe haemorrhaging, severe blood loss."" Children who have survived have been left with ""severe life-changing injuries"", she said. ""Two deaths is too many as far as we're concerned. Two or three patients having severe injuries is too many when it's something potentially preventable.""

45,32614939,"Racing Metro centre Roberts, 28, is understood to have rejected Cardiff Blues and agreed to join Quins after the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Head coach Gatland has previously stated he would prefer Welsh internationals to play in Wales. ""There's not a hard and fast rule as there is with England,"" Gatland told BBC Wales Sport. ""There are exceptions where players have been playing outside of Wales and there are one or two wildcards we could pick. ""They do play outside of Wales but they could be selected, but I think the long-term goal is to have a policy where, ideally, we pick players who are playing in Wales."" English players who move to play abroad are currently not considered for national team selection. To complete the move to Quins, Roberts must first be released by French Top 14 club Racing Metro, where he has a contract until June 2016. Under the so-called 'Gatland's Law', Wales-based players are likely to be favoured for Test selection over those who choose to play elsewhere. In August 2014, the Welsh Rugby Union and Wales' four professional regions signed a £60m, six-year deal that settled a long-running dispute over the sport's future. That deal included rules that mean players based outside Wales could also be overlooked in favour of home-based talent, with coach Gatland expected to tighten selection policy. The selection policy ruled that no player based overseas should represent Wales, although Gatland is able to make exceptions. However, that only applied to players who moved before the deal was agreed, and so at the time would not have applied to Roberts, who joined Racing in June 2013. A move to Harlequins now would bring the centre into the category of players who could be overlooked for selection, though Gatland remains pragmatic on the matter. ""The ideal for me is you want players playing in Wales,"" Gatland said at an event where tickets went on sale for Wales' World Cup warm-up matches. ""It's important we work closely with the regions to make them as successful as possible. ""That will encourage players to stay and encourage players to come back to Wales.""

Private trusts and foundations also gave £634,000, while the Art Fund donated £350,000 and the Scottish government £100,000. Sir John Leighton, director-general of the National Galleries of Scotland said: ""We are thrilled that we have been able to secure this iconic work for the national collection. ""The enormous support from the public has been incredible with donations coming from all over the world and from the length and breadth of Scotland and the rest of the UK.

In his original statement, Sir Norman said: ""Fans' behaviour, to the extent that it was relevant at all, made the job of the police, in the crush outside Leppings Lane turnstiles, harder than it needed to be."" John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, said many of his constituents were at the game and had called for Sir Norman to resign. ""After the statement he made when he seemed to have a go again at Liverpool fans, I think his position is untenable. He has got to go.""

53,40387580,"The jury was unable to reach a verdict after 30 hours of deliberation in charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter against Ray Tensing, 27. The Cincinnati officer killed Sam DuBose, 43, after pulling him over on 19 July 2015. A prosecutor called it the ""most asinine act"" ever by a police officer. Judge Leslie Ghiz declared the mistrial on Friday after the jury of nine white and three black people were unable to reach a verdict. The jurors told the judge they were almost evenly split. It is the fourth high-profile failure recently to convict a police officer in the death of a black man: Mr Tensing stopped Mr DuBose near campus for a missing front licence plate, and police body cam shows their initial exchange was friendly. The officer asks for Mr DuBose's driver's licence, but he says he does not have it. He also shows an unopened bottle of alcohol in the car. Mr Tensing then asks Mr DuBose to unbuckle his seatbelt. Almost immediately after that, a shot is fired and the car appears to move. The officer fired a single round, hitting Mr DuBose in the head. Mr Tensing had testified that he feared he could be run over as Mr DuBose tried to drive away. But an expert said his frame-by-frame analysis of Mr Tensing's body camera video showed he was not being dragged by the car. Donyetta Bailey, who is president of the Black Lawyer's Association of Cincinnati, said the Tensing case and others underline that juries are ""implicitly biased"" in favour of police officers. ""It shows our legal system has no value for African-American human rights,"" said Ms Bailey, reports the Cincinnati Enquirer. Mr Tensing was fired last year by the University of Cincinnati, which announced an overhaul of its policing department. The university also reached a $5.3m (Â£4.1m) settlement with Mr DuBose's family, including free undergraduate tuition for his 13 children. Mr Tensing's first trial last year also ended with the jury deadlocked.","The jury was unable to reach a verdict after 30 hours of deliberation in charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter against Ray Tensing, 27.

Bristol Crown Court was told the truck was too big to legally travel down Lansdown Lane in Bath. Driver Phillip Potter, 20, of Dauntsey, denies causing the deaths by dangerous and careless driving. His boss Matthew Gordon, 30, of Dauntsey, who was driving another truck in front of Mr Potter, also denies 14 offences while the truck company's mechanic Peter Wood, 55, of Brinkworth, denies four charges. Prosecutor, Adam Vaitilingam QC told the court Lansdown Lane, which has a 6ft (1.8m) width restriction for HGVs, was known locally as a ""rat run"". He said: ""These two lorries were both a lot wider that 6ft - they were about 8.5ft (2.6m) wide - and they were not using Lansdown Lane for access - they were using it as a short cut. ""They were ignoring the prohibitions. These lorries were not allowed to be and should never have been on Lansdown Lane."" The jury heard tachograph records show the drivers had not taken mandatory breaks in the hours before the collision and both lorries were speeding as they approached Lansdown Lane. Mr Vaitilingam said the ABS warning light, which indicates problems with the braking system, was on in Mr Potter's lorry meaning it should not have been driven. Mr Potter and Mr Gordon were driving two trucks carrying 32-tonne loads from a Wiltshire quarry on 9 February last year when the crash happened. The court previously heard the brakes of Mr Potter's truck failed and the vehicle hit several pedestrians including Mitzi and a car containing Mr Allen and Mr Vaughan, both from Swansea, and Mr Parker, from Cwmbran, south Wales. Mr Potter is also charged with causing serious injuries to Karla Brennan and Margaret Rogers - Mitzi's grandmother - by dangerous driving. He denies a total of 10 charges against him.

Taiwan said the eight were among 23 Taiwanese people who were accused in Kenya of being members of a telephone fraud ring, which also included Chinese nationals. They were arrested in Kenya at the end of last year and charged with illegal entry and telecommunications fraud. All of the Taiwanese, and some Chinese, were later acquitted. The Taiwanese were detained when they went to a police station last week to retrieve their passports. On Friday, eight of them were put on a plane by Chinese officials and sent to the mainland, despite a court order that would have kept them in Kenya, say Taiwanese officials. Taiwan has demanded their release, as well as for the release of the remaining 15 Taiwanese still in Kenyan custody. On Monday, Taiwan's foreign affairs ministry accused Chinese officials of ""obstructions"", including delaying the court order and preventing Taiwan's representative from reaching the acquitted. It said China's actions amounted to an ""uncivilised act of extrajudicial abduction"" which represents a ""gross violation of basic human rights."" In response to a reporter's question on the matter, China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said: ""I might need further understanding of the exact details of the case, but in principle, countries which follow the 'one China' principle are worthy of approval.""

63,33421376,"Eighty-five per cent of all births in Brazilian private hospitals are caesareans and in public hospitals the figure is 45%. The new rules oblige doctors to inform women about the risks and ask them to sign a consent form before performing a caesarean. Doctors will also have to justify why a caesarean was necessary. They will have to fill in a complete record of how the labour and birth developed and explain their actions. Each pregnant woman will now be assigned medical notes which record the history of her pregnancy, which she can take with her if she changes doctors. The new rules are designed to reduce unnecessary surgical procedures, and ensure pregnant women are aware of the risks associated with caesareans. However, experts say that a scarcity of maternity beds and wards equipped to deal with natural births means that for many women in Brazil, caesarean birth is seen as the best option. ""The best way to guarantee yourself a bed in a good hospital is to book a caesarean,"" Pedro Octavio de Britto Pereira, an obstetrician and professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said in an interview with BBC Brasil last year. Women who want to give birth naturally in a private hospital have reported finding all the beds are reserved for scheduled deliveries. There have been numerous reports of women going into labour without a caesarean scheduled and being forced to travel from hospital to hospital in search of a bed. Researchers say many women also see caesareans as more civilised and modern, and natural birth as primitive, ugly and inconvenient. In Brazil's body-conscious culture, where there is little information given about childbirth, there is also huge concern that natural birth can make women sexually unattractive. Many doctors prefer caesareans too, as they can plan the time of a birth, and feel more protected from litigation. Gynaecologist Renato Sa told BBC Brasil: ""Doctors are responsible for what happens and in a situation of risk they chose a caesarean, because if there is a death or complication they will be asked why they didn't do this.

64,18292852,"The requiem mass was held at St Mary's Church on the Melmount Road. The teenager who died in a water-filled quarry in County Tyrone is the third member of his extended family to die in a drowning tragedy. The body of Rhys Jack was recovered from the disused quarry in the Backtown area of Strabane on Tuesday afternoon. Parish priest, Father Michael Doherty, said both of the teenager's parents had lost family members through drowning. His mother lost her five-year-old brother about 40 years ago, while his father's uncle drowned in recent years. Father Doherty has been with members of the Jack family since the tragedy began to unfold on Monday evening. The 17-year-old was in the quarry with three teenage friends when they fell into the water from a makeshift raft. His three friends, who were later rescued, had frantically tried to save him. Father Doherty told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that Rhys's parents, Elaine and Mark, identified his body at the quarry shortly after it was recovered by search teams. He said: ""They knew over the past day, or from about eight o'clock last night (20:00 BST) that although they would have liked to have thought there was a chance he would be still alive, they knew that he was gone and their hope was that the body would be found sooner rather than later."" The priest said that their ""deep sadness"" at losing their son was mixed with ""relief"". He explained that the corpse of Elaine Jack's young brother had never been found, so they were relieved that Rhys's body had been recovered. He also said it was his understanding that Mark Jack's uncle had drowned in the River Finn a number of years ago. Father Doherty was the Jack family's parish priest and had baptised Rhys 17 years ago. He was also a chaplain at the teenager's school. The priest said the three friends who had tried to save Rhys were ""traumatised and upset"". He described the atmosphere in Rhys's school as ""subdued"" and said staff had tried to make special arrangements for those taking exams.","The requiem mass was held at St Mary's Church on the Melmount Road.

Last year's match had to be abandoned as Serbian fans invaded the pitch and attacked Albanian players. Security for the Serbia team is high in Albania before Thursday's match. Although the match will take place in Elbasan, an hour's drive to the south-east of Tirana, the Serbia team are staying at a hotel in the capital surrounded by police. As the team bus arrived in Tirana, stones were thrown and a window was cracked. Serbian media reported that Albanian officials had refused to receive a note of protest from Belgrade, insisting nothing had happened. Reports from Tirana spoke of roads inside the city being closed amid a major police operation. Albania are third in their Euro 2016 qualifying group, behind Portugal and Denmark, but far ahead of Serbia and still hoping to qualify for the knock-out stages of the competition. Police arrested the 33-year-old suspect and three other men, saying they had found a Zastava pistol and several cartridges, as well as 36 tickets for Thursday's match. Tensions had already been high before the Euro 2016 tie at the Partizan Stadium in Belgrade and ordinary Albanian fans were not allowed to attend the match. The two countries have had a long and bitter history of rivalry, and ethnic-Albanian-majority Kosovo's decision to declare independence from Serbia in 2008 brought relations to a new low. Ismail Morinaj admitted flying the drone from a church across the road from the stadium. As it hovered above the pitch, a large ""greater Albania"" flag could be seen, portraying nationalist claims to neighbouring states. Serbia defender Stefan Mitrovic snatched at the drone and fans poured on to the pitch, attacking Albania players. The ensuing brawl and the decision to abandon the game prompted football officials to deduct three points from Serbia, and they stand at the bottom of their group in Euro 2016.

NICE said efforts were needed to ""dispel confusion"" over allergies after ""major issues"" were discovered as the guidelines were drawn up. It called for improvements in the way doctors collect information on patients' allergies. It also wants a re-design of all prescriptions to include information on the classes of drugs to which a patient is known to be allergic. Signs of allergy include fever, hives, wheezing, redness and swelling. Dr Shuaib Nasser, a consultant allergist at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, stated: ""The guideline stresses the care all healthcare professionals must take when documenting new drug allergies and the importance of sharing this information with patients and other healthcare professionals.

Dr Denarie worked in Bristol at Southmead Hospital in two periods in from January to April 2014 and then later that year from May to July. He also reviewed cases from St Michaels Hospital in Bristol during those periods.

The Department of Health supported the move, but Labour argued it suggested there was a financial crisis in the NHS that was ""spiralling out of control"". David Bennett, chief executive of Monitor, said the NHS was facing an almost unprecedented financial challenge this year. ""We are already reviewing and challenging the plans of the 46 foundation trusts with the biggest deficits,"" he wrote in a letter to trusts. ""However, it is clear that this process will not close the funding gap and so we need all providers - even those planning for a surplus this year - to look again at their plans to see what more can be done."" He urged trusts to leave non-essential vacancies unfilled, and to follow guidelines on safe staffing in a way which was ""proportionate and appropriate"". Rosters should be rigorously managed to deploy staff efficiently across all required shifts, including evenings and weekends, he said. In May, NHS trusts in England reported a total deficit of £822m in 2014-15, compared with £115m the previous year. A big rise in spending on agency nurses contributed to the deficits. At the time, Monitor said figures for this financial year were likely to be even worse. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the warning by Monitor ""suggests that the financial crisis in the NHS is threatening to spiral out of control and hit standards of patient care"". He added: ""The suggestion that hospitals can ignore safe staffing guidance will alarm patients and the government must decide if it will overrule this advice."" The Department of Health said it was investing £8bn into the NHS in England so that it could implement a five-year plan, and it was vital that ""every penny possible"" was spent on patient care.

""We have had three attacks involving fatalities and six thwarted attacks in the past 12 months,"" he said. ""To put that in some sort of historic perspective, that represents just over a third of the attacks or planned attacks that we've had in this country over the last 15 years."" Asio - Australia's domestic security agency - increased the National Terrorism Public Alert Level from medium to high in September last year. This signifies that an attack is ""likely"". Mr Lewis said this had been reviewed following the Paris attacks but that there were no plans to move it to the highest level of ""extreme"" which indicates an attack is imminent. ""If you consider there have been three successful attacks in Australia since that time, then I think that the threat level of 'likely' is most appropriate. ""We have no specific information leading us to believe there is any imminent threat of an attack presently, it is not appropriate for us to move the threat level to the next elevated position.

It said it was concerned it could lead to greater numbers of adults who lacked confidence in the water. The Scottish government said the top-up scheme had ended but swimming was still well-funded. Swimming is not a compulsory part of the curriculum in Scotland, unlike in England. The provision of primary school swimming lessons varies extensively between local authorities, with children living in the most socially deprived areas having the highest number of non-swimmers. Scottish Swimming claimed that as many as 40% of children, about 15,000 each year, headed to high school as non-swimmers. Its ""Top Up"" swimming programme supported local authorities to deliver swimming lessons for pupils. Scottish Swimming said ""Top Up"" helped up to 30,000 children to improve their swimming skills. Sports Minister Jamie Hepburn said: ""The Top Up programme was designed to help develop a model to enable swimming clubs and local authorities to teach children to swim by providing some initial additional investment to assist local provision. The programme received Â£1.72m over four years. ""Although the top-up programme has now ended, Scottish Swimming received more than Â£5m (over four years) in the latest funding round from sportscotland. This is the largest funding settlement of all the Commonwealth Games sports."" Shelagh Dow, the head teacher at Granton primary in Edinburgh, said financial pressures stopped many families from going swimming. She said the loss of the programme would have an impact.

The PAC has been running an investigation into the handling of the non-domestic RHI for several months. The green energy scheme was intended to increase the creation of heat from renewable sources. However, businesses were receiving more in subsidies than they were paying for renewable fuel and the scheme became majorly oversubscribed. The fallout from the scandal surrounding the scheme, which is approximately £490m over budget, resulted in the collapse of Stormont's institutions and the calling of snap elections on 2 March. Mrs Lockhart told the committee on Wednesday her brother-in-law had been a recipient of the heat subsidy since 2014, but she had been unaware of that fact until January 2017. She was responding to a request from UUP MLA and committee chair Robin Swann for any committee member with an interest in the scheme to declare it. Mrs Lockhart said as well as being unaware of her relative's involvement with RHI, she did not ""help or assist with the application process"". ""My mother and father have poultry farms and do not have RHI and I can let any journalist see my bank statements and they will see there's no benefit from RHI,"" she said.

But recent studies have found a connection between repeated concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a disease with symptoms including memory loss and mood swings.

They join an additional 1,500 former NFL players who have put their names to similar lawsuits.

Mr Yunis told the researcher not to worry about the police. Fraudulent use of SIA cards in fact carries a maximum six-month prison sentence. Both the exam board whose certification was fraudulently obtained, Industry Qualifications (IQ), and the Security Industry Authority (SIA) are investigating the college. An audit is currently taking place, with the aim of ascertaining how many qualifications awarded at the college to enable security guards to become licensed by the SIA were bogus. Jobseekers must sit mandatory exams to get an SIA card. A statement placed on Ashley Commerce College's website by IQ read: ""Following the BBC broadcast, IQ has been working with the regulators Ofqual and the SIA to formulate a plan for identifying learners affected by the fraud. ""We do expect to find evidence that some learners have received their qualifications without having done their course or tests properly. These qualifications will be reviewed. ""We know that this will leave many learners who attended ACC worried about the authenticity of their qualifications and IQ is working hard to find out how many learners may be affected."" The statement said every student who obtained an SIA licence through the college may be affected. The college has been operating since 2010. The statement added: ""Where we cannot guarantee that a qualification has not been affected by fraud, we are required to remove the qualification immediately and notify the Security Industry Authority."" Mr Yunis would not say how many students' qualifications were now being reviewed. Keith Vaz MP, the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, called the fraud a ""major scandal"".

There are new commissions from Susan Philipsz, Andrew Miller, Emily Speed, Kevin Harman and Anthony Schrag. There are also retrospectives of acclaimed artists such as Ian Hamilton Finlay, Leslie Hunter and John Bellany. Scots-born sound artist Philipsz, who won the Turner prize in 2010, will bring Timelines to the capital - a multi-site installation, developed in response to one of Edinburgh's famous One O'Clock Gun. The gun is fired every day, except Sunday, from Edinburgh castle. Philipsz's voice will call out each day in response to the firing of the gun, creating a domino effect as speakers sound along the timeline from Calton Hill to Edinburgh Castle. Other new commissions include a pavilion made from salvaged materials and artworks made from rubble in skips. As well as the commissions, the festival will feature new exhibitions by international artists such as Rachel Mayeri. The Los Angeles-based artist collaborated with comparative psychologist Dr Sarah-Jane Vick to develop Primate Cinema: Apes as family. It is a two-screen video installation that presents a drama written for chimpanzees and performed by human actors alongside the reactions of an audience of chimps. It was researched and partly filmed at Edinburgh Zoo. Dutch artist Melvin Moti is holding his first UK solo show, at the National Museums of Scotland. One Thousand Points of Light features a new film focusing on light-reactive minerals and objects the artist has chosen from National Museums of Scotland's collections, ranging from fluorescing fossils to a glowing jellyfish. There will also be several ""summer blockbuster"" exhibitions, with one exploring Picasso's lifelong connections with Britain, at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. Another major exhibition will feature the work of Van Gogh and Kandinsky, at the Scottish National Gallery.

But that view is now ""long gone"". While he was ""a very early convert"", he said the closeness of the referendum result - 50.3% voted for and 49.7% voted against setting up the assembly - created ""a great deal of nervousness"". He said: ""My opinion was always the proof of the pudding is in the eating, it's about what the institution does - in terms of social change - that really matters."" Mr Lewis felt strongly that devolution could be used to tackle areas in which Wales was at a particular disadvantage to England, including health, education and combating poverty. The former chemistry teacher described taking on the education portfolio as ""a dream come true"" and said reforms to the curriculum and teacher training were two of his proudest achievements. He said: ""The old England and Wales schools-based education agenda no longer exists. ""Wales now has its own distinctive path and own distinctive future in terms of what our schools are going to look like."" He said the reforms happening here were based on ""real evidence"" and not ""ideologically driven"", which is what he fears is happening in England with the ""marketisation of education"". By implementing a Scandinavian-style model - that includes children learning through play - he hopes teachers will be better skilled and standards will rise. ""We're not emulating England, we're emulating the best,"" Mr Lewis said. This is despite an assumption he believes is made by many that Wales should see England as a ""gold standard"" and if something different is tried here, it is somehow suspect and second rate. ""I hope, that as devolution has matured over the years, we are finally beginning to break away from that kind of mentality,"" he added. ""We are quite capable of setting out our own agenda and following it and basing it, in global terms, on what the best looks like. ""That's the real dividend from devolution.

It is the first such death since US special forces deployed in Syria in October 2015. Meanwhile at least 32 people have been killed in intense Syrian air strikes on rebel-held east Aleppo, monitors say. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors casualties, said the attack was one of the heaviest since Syrian forces resumed an offensive on the east earlier this month. A statement from the anti-IS US-led coalition said the serviceman died on Thursday from wounds sustained in the blast. Coalition commander Lt Gen Stephen Townsend called the soldier a ""hero"" and praised those he said were protecting his country from IS's ""hateful and brutal ideology"". ""On this Thanksgiving, please be thankful that there are service members willing to take up the fight to protect our homeland,"" he said. US Defence Secretary Ash Carter said the soldier's death was a ""painful reminder of the dangers our men and women in uniform face around the world to keep us safe"". About 300 US special forces personnel have been deployed in Syria to advise an anti-IS alliance of Arab, Kurdish and other fighters, and improve the coalition's targeting of air strikes. Meanwhile, the Syrian government has intensified its offensive on east Aleppo, monitors and activists say. ""There was an escalation in the evening, with successive bombardments,"" SOHR director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP news agency, adding that many people were trapped under rubble. Five children were reported to be among the dead. Syrian forces stepped up ground and air attacks on eastern Aleppo in November following a three-week moratorium. Once Syria's commercial and industrial hub, Aleppo has been divided roughly in two since 2012, with the government controlling the west and rebels the east. In late September, two weeks after encircling the east and reimposing a siege on its estimated 275,000 residents, the army launched an all-out assault to take full control of the city. Rebels launched a counter-attack in an attempt to break the siege in late October.

92,36921706,"Mourinho has already made three big summer signings and is closing in on Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba. Schweinsteiger, 31, looks like being one of nine players who may leave.

Forwards Adnan Januzaj, Will Keane and James Wilson, midfielder Andreas Pereira and defenders Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, Tim Fosu-Mensah, Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair are also reportedly set to be made available, though some may only leave on loan. With all the other senior players who were absent from the recent tour of China present, Schweinsteiger's absence from Thursday's squad training session is being viewed as significant. United paid a reported £14.4m to sign him from Bayern Munich 12 months ago but the move did not work out as planned. Injury restricted Schweinsteiger to 31 appearances and he was involved in just seven of United's final 34 games, including missing the FA Cup final win over Crystal Palace. He injured a knee on international duty in March and only returned at Euro 2016, when he scored on his first appearance, as a substitute, against Ukraine. Of the other players who did not train with the United squad on Thursday, Januzaj has had the biggest fall from grace. The 21-year-old Belgian was one of the star performers in David Moyes' single season in charge, when he earned himself a big increase in a five-year contract. But his progress was not maintained and he was loaned to Borussia Dortmund last season. He did not start a league game and the German side were happy to let United cut the deal short midway through the season when Louis van Gaal's squad were badly affected by injury. He then featured for 17 minutes in three substitute appearances.

The kit also includes an SD storage card, official case, power supply, HDMI cable, mouse, keyboard and guidebook - it costs Â£99 plus VAT and will be available in the coming weeks. The Pi, which is manufactured in Wales, has been adopted by pupils, programmers and inventors around the world. Many have received versions for free via the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a charity. British astronaut Tim Peake even took two to the International Space Station. ""We thought our lifetime volumes might amount to 10,000 units - if we were lucky,"" wrote founder Eben Upton in a blog. ""There was no expectation that adults would use Raspberry Pi, no expectation of commercial success and certainly no expectation that four years later we would be manufacturing tens of thousands of units a day in the UK and exporting Raspberry Pi all over the world."" The latest sales figures were ""fantastic"", said tech industry analyst Chris Green - who owns four of the computers himself - at business consultancy Lewis. ""It's more than just a geeky coding tool - it's increasingly proving itself as a useful computer,"" he told the BBC.

However, the Labour MP has not ruled out some kind of deal with the SNP. Mr Murphy told BBC political editor Brian Taylor that it was ""disrespectful"" to discuss political deals before the general election. On the suggestion of his party entering into a Conservative arrangement in the event of a hung parliament, Mr Murphy was very clear. He said: ""We don't need lessons from Tory dinosaurs about how to run Scotland, what a ludicrous idea."" Mr Murphy added that the differences between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party were bigger than ""I have seen for a number of years"". Writing in The Independent, Lord Baker of Dorking said a Labour minority government reliant on the SNP would be a ""nightmare"" situation at Westminster. He added that such an arrangement could ""stretch the constitution of our country to breaking point"". However, the SNP said it was trusted more than Labour to keep the Tories out. Asked if a deal with the nationalists was possible, Mr Murphy said he did not want to get into a ""post-match analysis on an event that has not yet taken place"". He told Brian Taylor during a half-hour webcast: ""As I say, if the SNP want to vote for our policies in the House of Commons, it's up to them - some time they have done that in recent times, quite often they have sided with the Tories against Labour."" Mr Murphy said he had no desire to focus on the ""politics of pessimism"" because he wanted his party to win government. The debate over coalition deals has arisen because polling suggests neither Labour nor the Conservatives would gain an overall majority in this year's election. If that is the case a coalition deal with smaller parties could be possible or a so-called ""confidence and supply"" arrangement could be agreed whereby the smaller party supports the larger party in key votes. During the webchat Mr Murphy was also asked about tuition fees, the Scottish independence referendum and his decision to fight his East Renfrewshire seat in May.","Jim Murphy was responding to former Tory chairman Lord Baker's view that there could be a deal between the two rival parties after May's election.

96,36431996,"Investigators have found signs of metal fatigue in components from the aircraft that crashed off Norway in April, killing 13 people. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said both H225 and AS332 (L2) variants should cease flying. Iain Stuart from Aberdeenshire was among those killed in the crash. Mr Stuart, 41, from Laurencekirk, was working for the oil field services company Halliburton and was a passenger on the helicopter. The Airbus Super Puma 225 was travelling from the Gullfaks field to Bergen when it crashed near the small island of Turoey on 29 April. The pilots had no time to issue a mayday and the main rotor is believed to have become detached before impact. On Wednesday a preliminary report issued by the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) said it had found ""features strongly consistent with fatigue"" in parts of the main gearbox (MGB). It added: ""It cannot be ruled out that this signifies a possible safety issue that can affect other MGBs of the same type. ""The nature of the catastrophic failure of the LN-OJF main rotor system indicates that the current means to detect a failure in advance are not effective."" The Super Puma H225 helicopter had already grounded in the UK and Norway since the crash but the latest EASA directive includes the other main variant of the Super Puma and extends the ban across Europe. An online petition calling for all Super Puma 225s to be ""permanently removed from service"" has attracted nearly 30,000 signatures. Tommy Campbell, chair of the Offshore Coordinating Group (OCG) of trade unions said: ""The Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) report is a further development in the investigation process, but it is just part of that process. ""The OCG will await the outcome of investigations aimed at providing proof around what caused the tragedy in Norway and thereafter we will react to those findings.

97,24348811,"A team from Strathclyde University in Glasgow tested 22 different brands of compost and found that 14 contained a variety of Legionella species. It says a larger survey is needed to determine the extent of the issue. The study, ""Legionella spp. in UK composts - a potential public health issue"", is published by Clinical Microbiology and Infection. Dr Beattie, one of those who conducted the study, said: ""Disease causing micro-organisms are widespread in the environment, and therefore it is not too surprising that species of Legionella that can cause human disease are present in compost. ""Any environment where you have pathogenic bacteria could be a source of infection, and we already know that compost has been linked to human Legionella infection in countries such as Australia and New Zealand."" Dr Beattie said European produced composts have traditionally been composed of peat, whereas those from Australia and New Zealand had more often used sawdust and bark. ""It may be that the change in composition of composts in the UK, moving away from peat-based products, could be resulting in species such as Legionella longbeachae being present in compost and therefore more cases of infection could occur,"" she said. Dr Beattie wants a larger scale survey, covering a wider range of compost products, to be carried out to see if Legionella bacteria are as widespread in composts as her study suggests. She added: ""It should be emphasised though, that although Legionella seem to be common in compost, human infection is very rare, especially if you consider the volume of compost sold and used. ""But with any potential source of infection precautions should always be taken.

98,33518710,"Falls in clothing and food prices were the main contributors to the change in the rate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The ONS said the rate was also affected by a smaller rise in air fares in June than a year ago. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said he expects inflation to remain low in the immediate short term. But the Bank expects it to start picking up around the turn of the year. The rate of Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation - which includes housing costs such as mortgage interest payments and council tax - was 1% in June, unchanged from May. ""Inflation has continued its pattern of recent months, when prices have been very little changed on the previous year,"" said Philip Gooding from the ONS. ""The headline rate for June has dropped very slightly on May, back to zero, thanks to small downwards effects from movements in clothing and food prices and air fares."" The CPI rate has been hovering around zero since February, and moved into negative territory in April for the first time on record, dropping to -0.1%. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said the latest figure was good news for consumers. ""With earnings growth currently seeing clear improvement and employment high and rising, purchasing power is currently in rude heath,"" he added. While flat or low inflation can be good news for consumers, a prolonged period of negative inflation is generally perceived as harmful to an economy. The fear is that people will defer spending in the hope that goods or services will become cheaper later. The current inflation figure is well below the Bank of England's target of around 2%. Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, fell last month to 0.8%. That was down from 0.9% and the joint-lowest rate since 2001. ""The data therefore raise questions over the whether underlying price pressures are really picking up to the extent than the Bank of England is anticipating,"" said Chris Williamson, chief UK economist at Markit. He said that attention would now turn to Wednesday's wage growth data, ""The Bank of England needs to determine whether pay growth will continue to accelerate as firms compete for staff, or whether low inflation will keep the overall rate of increase below levels that would normally worry the monetary policy committee into hiking interest rates,"" he added.","Falls in clothing and food prices were the main contributors to the change in the rate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Many tech gadgets such as smartphones use conflict materials, so-called because they are mined in warlike conditions and traded by armed groups.

European politicians will vote on proposals drawn up by the European Commission on 19 May. Signed by Amnesty International. Friends of the Earth, Global Witness, Christian Aid, the Ethical Consumer Research Association and many others, the open letter says the trade in conflict minerals fuels wars and human rights abuses around the world. It says the vote this week is a ""landmark opportunity"" for Europe to take action to stem the trade and curtail the conflict it engenders. However, it says the current proposals are ""weak"" and do not go far enough. The big problem with the scheme proposed by Brussels is that it applies on a voluntary basis to most companies, the groups argue. As a result, they say, few firms would be motivated to clean up their supply chains and report on their actions. In addition, the letter says, the scheme only covers four minerals - tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold - in their raw form, and does nothing to address products entering Europe which have been made using conflict minerals. Many smartphones, tablets and other devices made in China are manufactured using these substances. The letter says the scheme does not cover minerals and materials such as diamonds, jade and chromite, which are also known to be sources of conflict. It urges MEPs to reject the plans in favour of a stronger scheme involving a mandatory system to ensure firms vet their supply chain.

103,28872944,"Researchers suggest there is poor evidence to support screening and isolating infected patients - standard practice in hospitals worldwide. But good hand hygiene and bathing with antibacterial solutions are key to reducing infections, they say. Experts warn more studies are needed before any change in protocols. Despite rates of Meticillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) falling in many countries, concerns about its spread remain. The bug is resistant to most antibiotics and while it is can be carried harmlessly on the skin it may lead to serious wound infections - particularly in people who are already unwell. Hospitals have used a varied combination of methods to tackle it, including: Scientists reviewed studies over the last decade. But most investigated several infection control measures in combination, making it difficult to tease out which ones worked best. Researchers say the limited evidence focusing solely on isolation or screening suggest they may not reduce spread of the disease and could do more harm than good. Prof Gerd Fatkenheuer, from the University Hospital Cologne, Germany, who was part of the research team said: ""In the haste to do something against the rising tide of MRSA infection, measures were adopted that seemed plausible but were not properly assessed, bundling the effective and harmless with the ineffective and harmful. ""We know for example that isolating patients can result in anxiety and depression and fewer visits by doctors and nurses."" The scientists emphasise evidence backs good hand-washing and suggests people with the bug should bathe daily using antibacterial solutions. Prof Peter Collignon at the Canberra Hospital, Australia said: ""Certain countries, however, that take all of these combined approaches - such as the Netherlands and Denmark - have the lowest rates of MRSA spread in healthcare facilities. ""So we need to make sure that studies clearly show that we will not do harm by stopping some or all of these isolation methods."" The report authors say as MRSA levels continue to drop this provides a good opportunity to reassess how best to tackle the problem. And they recommend scarce resources could be redeployed to combat other infections - rather than singling out MRSA. Recent figures for England suggest 862 cases of MRSA were recorded in the year 2013-14, a substantial reduction from the 4,451 cases reported in 2007-08.","Researchers suggest there is poor evidence to support screening and isolating infected patients - standard practice in hospitals worldwide.

The new outing is being directed by JJ Abrams and is set for release in December 2015. The two robot builders have previously employed their skills on Star Wars-themed commercials, but it was a visit of LucasFilm president Kathleen Kennedy to a convention in Germany that got their work noticed - and landed them jobs on the new film. ""I mentioned that the R2-D2 Builders in the UK were available if required, as a semi-joke. When I was contacted to work on the film by executive producer Jason McGatlin, it was on her recommendation,"" said Mr Steeples. ""It's a dream come true,"" he added. ""I hope I can live up to the expectations of the thousands of R2-D2 builders around the world, let alone the millions of Star Wars fans."" The pair, who have been constructing R2-D2 units for some years, will be responsible for maintaining the robots during the making of the film, and will try to improve on its design. The robot is a mesh of gears, lights and electronics which need to be kept in excellent condition throughout the production of the movie. British actor Kenny Baker was inside the machine for the first six Star Wars films. It has not been revealed whether he will rejoin the series for Episode VII.

106,36672411,"The court is considering its verdict in an infringement hearing about emissions from coal-fired Aberthaw. It is alleged the site has been pumping out more than double the legal amount of toxic nitrogen oxides for seven years. The UK Government argues the power station is not in breach of the rules. It further claims that the Vale of Glamorgan plant has made major investments to try to improve its performance. In a document summarising his opinion of the case, advocate general of the European Court of Justice, Michal Bobek, says he finds the arguments put by the UK to be ""untenable"". He proposes that the court find the UK to be in breach of its obligations under EU rules to limit pollution levels. Director of Friends of the Earth Cymru, Gareth Clubb, said: ""Since at least 2001, Aberthaw power station has had no legal justification for emitting horrific amounts of toxic pollution into the atmosphere. ""The judgement spells disaster for Aberthaw. It's very difficult to see how it can avoid permanent closure once the Court of Justice reaches its final verdict."" In April, BBC Wales revealed that Aberthaw's operator, RWE, is set to downgrade the plant so that it only generates electricity at times of peak demand. The UK government has said it wants all coal-fired power stations to close by 2025. RWE said it was ""disappointed"" with the advocate general's opinion but would await the final EU court judgement. The UK government had claimed that an exemption in the law around air pollution for plants burning low volatile coal was aimed at sites such as Aberthaw, given that the anthracite coal it uses is sourced locally, harder to burn and important to the local economy. ""Aberthaw Power Station was specifically designed to burn Welsh, regional, low volatile coal and historically, 60% of its fuel diet is Welsh,"" a RWE spokesperson said, adding that ""the station has always been compliant with its operational permit."" ""Following a successful installation of new technology to one unit at the plant the nitrogen oxide emissions have been substantially reduced.

Autism cost the UK more than heart disease, stroke and cancer combined, said an autism charity. But only £6.60 per person is spent on autism research compared with £295 on cancer, according to Autistica. The research looked at the costs to society of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in both the UK and US. Autism cost the UK at least £32bn a year in terms of treatment, lost earnings, and care and support for children and adults with ASD, found the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics. This compared with £12bn for cancer, £8bn for heart disease and £5bn for stroke, said Autistica. The figures showed a clear need for more effective interventions to treat autism, ideally in early life, to make the best use of scarce resources, said lead researcher Prof Martin Knapp, of the London School of Economics and Political Science, in London. ""We need to use our resources earlier, identify people earlier and try to provide therapies and support that makes it easier to manage the condition,"" he told BBC News. He said new government policies were also needed to address ""the enormous impact on families"". Christine Swabey, chief executive of the autism research charity, Autistica, said there was an ""unacceptable imbalance"" between the high cost of autism and the amount spent on research. ""The right research would provide early interventions, better mental health, and more independence,"" she said. ""But right now we spend just £180 on research for every £1m we spend on care."" Commenting on the study, Prof Emily Simonoff, of King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry, said the finding was important because of the ""relatively low amounts of research funding that go to mental health, despite its huge burden"". More than 600,000 people in the UK have autism, a developmental disorder that can cause problems with social interaction, language skills and physical behaviour.

Wales were one of the top seeds for Saturday's 2018 World Cup draw in St Petersburg after a remarkable rise under Coleman to be ranked 10th in the world. Their reward was being one of the top nine seeds which ensured Wales would avoid the likes of world champions Germany and European champions Spain, arch-rivals England and hosts Russia. Wales avoided former World Cup winners France and Italy, who were in pot two, and instead will face Austria, who they beat 2-1 in a friendly when they last faced them in February 2013.

Former Wolves and Reading striker Doyle looked in danger of missing out on Euro 2016 as he was left writhing on the ground in Friday's game after making a block tackle. However, the striker allayed those fears on Saturday morning, saying he aimed to be ""back jogging in a few weeks"" after earlier tweeting a picture of his leg. Keane was ruled out of Friday's win over the Swiss and manager Martin O'Neill said after the game that the squad captain is now ""a wee bit concerned about the injury"". ""It's something he thought was a kick for a start, he thought it would clear up in a couple of days,"" said the Republic boss. ""He will miss Tuesday's game definitely now. I am hoping that's not a major concern at the moment and I genuinely don't think it is, so I don't want to start a bit of scaremongering."" Stoke striker Walters will again miss Tuesday's game as he continues to be bothered by a hamstring injury while Daryl Murphy, who replaced Doyle on Friday, has returned to his club Ipswich Town because of a calf strain. With Doyle's injury not as serious as first feared, O'Neill was reasonably content with a night's work which saw him running the rule over a number of fringe players. With Shane Duffy impressing in central defence, Shane Long hit the woodwork although the visitors missed late chances with Republic keeper Darren Randolph saving a deflected Granit Xhaka shot. ""We probably lacked a little bit of cohesion, but it was nice to keep the momentum going against what I thought was a very fine Swiss side,"" said O'Neill.","The Colorado Rapids striker has had surgery on his leg after he was taken off on a stretcher in the Dublin game.

116,32810573,"The city's Lord Provost Sadie Docherty lay a wreath at Dalbeth Cemetery in honour of five Glasgow Auxiliary Fire Service messenger boys. They died at the height of the German bombing on 13 and 14 March 1941. The boys were among 90 youngsters who cycled or ran with potentially lifesaving messages for front-line fire crews during the war. The lord provost laid the wreath in honour of all the messenger boys who died at a Celtic Cross which was erected at the grave of 15-year-old Neil Leitch. He died from bomb injuries sustained while trying to take a communication to Partick Fire Station. The teenager had been injured during an earlier mission when he was blown off his bicycle by a bomb. He defied orders to rest and continued with his duties until he was fatally injured. The lord provost said: ""I am proud to join others to remember the remarkable, and little known, bravery of Neil Leitch and all the other Fire Service volunteer boy cyclists across the country, who put their lives on the line to save others during the Second World War. ""Sadly Neil Leitch along with four others paid the ultimate price that terrible night as our city and its citizens were relentlessly bombed."" Following his death, Neil Leitch was gazetted by King George VI for his bravery and devotion to duty. His nephew James Leitch, a former Clydebank fireman who now lives in Orkney, attended the service along with family from across the UK. James said: ""I grew up hearing about my uncle Neil and this is something we have always wanted to do. ""These boys were forgotten. To me they deserve recognition. It will be an emotional day."" The lord provost was joined by George McGrandles, of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, the city's senior fire officer. He formed part of a Fire and Rescue Service Guard of Honour in tribute to the youngsters. ""The role of the boy messengers isn't widely known but it was absolutely vital,"" he said.

City and Guilds managing director Kirstie Donnelly said it was ""worrying"" to see the figures ""creep up after months of more positive news"". The Office of National Statistics figures date back to October to December 2001 when 833,000 young people were classified as NEET, some 12.9% of the total age-group. At the end of last year that proportion had fallen to 11.8%. NEET numbers reached from highs of over a million, or more than 16% of the age-group, in 2011, but have fallen consistently since. In England, the government raised the education participation age to 17 in September 2013 and to 18 in September 2015. So young people in England are now expected to stay in full-time education, in an apprenticeship, or in employment with training until they are 18. The UK-wide NEET figures first dropped below the million mark, to 987,000, or 13.5% of the age group in the first quarter of 2014. England-only figures show there were 690,000 NEETs at the end of last year, almost 100,000 fewer than in the last quarter of 2014. This figure is the lowest since 2000 when comparable records began and the number stood at 629,000, says the government. Skills Minister Nick Boles said the figures showed the government was delivering on its commitment to ensure all young people were either earning or learning. ""There is no room for complacency, though, and through our plans to deliver three million new apprenticeships by 2020 and our qualification reforms, we are determined to build on these excellent results,"" said Mr Boles. But campaigners say the figures are still too high ""More than one in every 10 teenagers is currently locked out of a path to the future,"" said Ms Donnelly. And Jenny North, policy and strategy director of Impetus PEF, which funds projects to help the most disadvantaged young people, called for more government action.

118,34860147,"I have been told that this afternoon Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has been briefing Labour MPs alongside one of his top military aides, Lieutenant General Gordon Messenger, the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Operations) who commanded British forces in Helmand. Mr Fallon is also planning to brief Labour MPs collectively at an open meeting in a couple of weeks' time, followed by another briefing for Tory MPs. And while Downing Street is still insisting that there is no guarantee there will be any vote over military action, that the prime minister will act only if he is absolutely certain of winning that vote, ministers believe the momentum is moving their way. One Cabinet minister told me: ""Yesterday was a game-changer. You could see the middle rank of Labour MPs, particularly the women, nodding along with the PM. Afterwards, he was bouncing. He really thinks the mood has changed."" And, having spent the morning talking to MPs at Westminster, that minister may be right. So what has changed? As for the numbers, ministers reckon the 30 Conservative opponents of extending military action to Syria can be squeezed down to about 20. They are hopeful of similar numbers of Labour MPs backing them and even more abstaining. The key aim for the Conservative whips is to try get enough mainstream Labour MPs onside for the government's policy rather than relying on old Blairites to stick it to Mr Corbyn. Also crucial will be the role of the eight Democratic Unionist Party MPs. Back in September, the DUP leader at Westminster Nigel Dodds firmly opposed military action in Syria. But I note the way Mr Cameron praised Mr Dodds in the House of Commons yesterday and Tory ministers tell me they are hopeful of winning DUP support. One DUP source said: ""We wait and see: if the PM makes a credible case for what the use of British military force can realistically achieve, we could of course support that."" As one Cabinet minister told me: ""There is now a confluence of events and stars in our favour. I think we can do this."" Maybe.

It also advised users to make sure the console had the latest software update and to ""try to decrease the distance"" between the Joy-Con and the console.

A video posted on YouTube suggested that while the right-hand Joy-Con had a dedicated antenna, the left-hand one was harder to find. ""The antenna is printed directly on the controller's circuit board; it's not a separate unit inside the device. Second, the antenna is located beneath the controller's shoulder button and next to the housing for the controller's joystick,"" said gaming website Polygon.

128,36732336,"Launched in February, the Hitomi X-ray satellite began tumbling out of control in March when contact was finally lost. Just before its demise, scientists managed to extract data measuring X-ray activity in the Perseus galaxy cluster. Published in Nature, data revealed the movement of gas between galaxy clusters was not as turbulent as expected. Hitomi, which translates as the pupil of the eye in Japanese, was meant to spend years studying the formation of galaxy clusters and the warping of space and time around black holes. It cost more than a quarter of a billion dollars - the research was an international collaboration involving the American space agency Nasa, and teams in Japan and many other countries, including one at Cambridge University in the UK. Scientists studying the data found that the hot gases between galaxies within the Perseus cluster was travelling at a slower speed - at 540,000 km/h (340,000 mph) - and in a less turbulent way than many expected. Measuring the turbulence and movement of such gas is important because the size of galaxy clusters is a useful tool for measuring ""the parameters of cosmology and the growth of structure in the universe"", researchers say. The gases in galaxy clusters are thought to be particularly hot and dense with a lot of dark matter and a supermassive black hole at the centre of it all. The interaction between all the various gases was thought to be very chaotic so Hitomi's observations appear to have defied predictions. ""The gas is relatively stable and isn't getting pushed around as much as we thought,"" said Brian McNamara, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, who was part of the research team. ""Hitomi's Perseus observation tells us that we can probably weigh distant galaxy clusters to greater accuracy than we can weigh our own Milky Way galaxy."" Hitomi was lost thanks to a sensor incorrectly detecting a roll in the spacecraft. In trying to correct it, on-board systems sent the craft into a spin until finally the solar panels that powered it are thought to have broken off. The next time a similar satellite will be launched is in 2028 by the European Space Agency.","Launched in February, the Hitomi X-ray satellite began tumbling out of control in March when contact was finally lost.

Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics said the figures would give some reassurance that higher inflation had not brought growth in consumer spending to a halt. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index jumped to 2.3% in February - up from 1.8% in January, the ONS said on Tuesday. However, Howard Archer at IHS Markit said consumers were becoming more cautious as higher inflation squeezed their purchasing power.

138,38636222,"The High Administrative Court rejected an appeal by the government against a lower court's decision to stop it handing over Tiran and Sanafir. Cheers erupted as the judge delivered the verdict, saying the government had failed to provide evidence that the islands were originally Saudi. The transfer deal, signed last April, sparked rare protests in Egypt. Tiran and Sanafir are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba. They are uninhabited apart from Egyptian troops and multi-national peacekeepers. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi said the islands had always belonged to Saudi Arabia and that Riyadh had asked Egypt to station troops there in 1950 to protect them. But Mr Sisi was accused of violating the constitution and ""selling"" the islands in return for a multi-billion dollar aid package announced during a visit to Cairo by King Salman. Saudi Arabia has backed Mr Sisi financially since he led the military's overthrow of his Islamist predecessor, Mohammed Morsi, in 2013. Uproar at the maritime border demarcation accord prompted protests across Egypt at which hundreds people were detained, according to human rights activists. A group of lawyers, including former presidential candidate Khaled Ali, also challenged the agreement at an administrative court. Mr Ali argued that a 1906 maritime treaty between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire stated that the islands were Egyptian. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia was not established until 1932. In June, the court nullified the border accord, ruling that Egyptian sovereignty over the islands held and could not be amended in favour of another state. The government subsequently lodged an appeal with the High Administrative Court. It is part of the State Council, a judicial body that gives legal advice to the government, drafts legislation, and exercises jurisdiction over administrative cases. On Monday, the High Administrative Court said it was the ""unanimous"" decision of its judges that Tiran and Sanafir were sovereign Egyptian territories.

139,27600394,"An army spokesman said a total of 253 people had been summoned. Fifty-three did not report and 76 were in custody. Conditions for the release appear to include agreeing to avoid political activity and informing the army of travel, a BBC correspondent says. Coup leaders, who took power last week, received royal endorsement on Monday. Thailand's former prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, has been released but remains under some restrictions. The army also says it is releasing a group of ""red-shirt"" protest leaders who support the ousted government. The anti-government protest leader has already been freed. So far, almost all of the 124 people who the army said they had detained and released have kept a very low profile, says the BBC's Jonah Fisher in Bangkok. It remains to be seen whether these ""red-shirt"" leaders - who support the ousted government - do the same, our correspondent adds. The military seized power in Thailand on 22 May, saying it wanted to return stability after months of unrest. The move followed six months of political deadlock as protesters rallied against Ms Yingluck's government. At least 28 people were killed and hundreds injured during the protests. On Monday a royal command approved the coup. But the military's actions in removing an elected government has drawn widespread international criticism. Correspondents say there is also a degree of scepticism about the total number of people in custody provided by the military, with reports of more widespread detentions. Rights groups have expressed alarm over the detentions, as well as the tight restrictions on media. On Monday, there were reports that internet users were briefly unable to access social media site Facebook. The country's information and technology ministry told the BBC there was a gateway problem. Experts have said that the coup is unlikely to heal highly polarised political divisions in the country. The current deadlock dates from 2006, when the military ousted Ms Yingluck's brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, in a coup. Both have strong support in rural and northern areas, propelling them to successive election wins. However, many in the middle class and urban elite, who comprise the heart of the anti-government movement that began in November 2013, oppose them bitterly.","An army spokesman said a total of 253 people had been summoned.

""The markets have always been more comfortable with the UK remaining in the European Union."" The pound had fallen sharply over the course of last week, after polls appeared to indicate the Leave campaign was taking the lead. But figures from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a US markets regulator, suggested a broader change in trading sentiment by Friday. That data indicated that by the end of last week, currency speculators had began to back the pound again by reducing their bets against the currency. That contrasted strongly to the first week of June, during which time traders' bets against the pound had risen to the highest level in three years. However, analysts say there is likely to be more volatility this week. ""Following the large sterling moves over last two days and limited risk premium priced in at this point, sterling now looks more vulnerable to negative surprise from the polls,"" ING strategist Petr Krpata said in a research note.

Police arrived to find him holding the other dog, and with a pair of scissors in his hand. Syratt, 31, from Ellon, admitted threatening or abusive behaviour when he appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. The animal charity said the dog was put to sleep because it had an incurable disease. Depute fiscal Katie Begg told the court that one of the rescue centre employees had been tasked with keeping Syratt informed about the progress of his dogs. She said: ""She did this by telephone and was in regular contact with him. One of the dogs had to be put down due to an incurable illness."" She said the employee contacted Syratt to let him know and he began to shout and swear at her, stating: ""I'm coming down and nothing will stop me"" and said he threatened to ""do in staff"". Some of the staff were then sent home and the building was locked up as a result of the call. One of the employees returned to her house opposite the rescue centre in Drumoak and saw Syratt arrive at the building later in the day. Ms Begg said: ""She then saw him tying a rope to the rear of his car to the door handle of the locus and he then accelerated forward in an attempt to remove the door."" After realising he had pulled the door handles off, Syratt then wandered into the building and forced his way into the cattery and kennels. Two police officers who arrived at the scene shortly afterwards found him in a central courtyard with his dog, and holding scissors. Ms Begg added: ""One of the police officers asked the accused if the dog was dangerous, to which he replied, 'No but I am'."" He later dropped the scissors, as requested. Defence lawyer Chris Maitland said his client denied threatening staff during the phone call. He said Syratt suffered a head injury in a road accident 10 years ago which may have changed his personality. He had a condition called Dissocial Personality Disorder for which there was no cure, he said.

Syratt, 31, from Ellon, admitted threatening or abusive behaviour when he appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. The animal charity said the dog was put to sleep because it had an incurable disease. Depute fiscal Katie Begg told the court that one of the rescue centre employees had been tasked with keeping Syratt informed about the progress ofs Begg added: ""One of the police officers asked the accused if the dog was dangerous, to which he replied, 'No but I am'."" He later dropped the scissors, as requested. Defence lawyer Chris Maitland said his client denied threatening staff during the phone call. He said Syratt suffered a head injury in a road accident 10 years ago which may have changed his personality. He had a condition called Dissocial Personality Disorder for which there was no cure, he said. The sheriff ordered Syratt to carry 80 hours of unpaid work.","A man forced his way into a Scottish SPCA rehoming centre after learning his dog had been put down, a court heard.",502,255

146,35959594,"""Revenge porn"" broadly describes the act of publishing explicit images of someone without their consent. The MPAA said the Minnesota draft law could restrict the publication of ""items of legitimate news, commentary, and historical interest"". But supporters of the proposal said its reach was ""plainly legitimate"". Revenge porn commonly refers to the sharing of intimate images after the end of a relationship, but is also used in a broader sense to describe any publication of explicit images without consent, for example when private photographs of a celebrity are leaked online. A number of countries and US states have introduced legislation that prohibits the practice, but there is no US-wide federal law on the subject. Opponents of revenge porn legislation have argued that some of the new laws are too broad in scope, and that existing copyright, communication and harassment laws sufficiently cover the subject. The MPAA, which represents six major Hollywood film studios, said the Minnesota law could ""limit the distribution of a wide array of mainstream, constitutionally protected material"". It cited images of Holocaust victims and prisoners at Abu Ghraib as examples of images depicting nudity which are shared without the subjects' consent. The MPAA called for the legislation to clarify that images shared without consent only broke the law if they were shared with an ""intent to harass"". In a statement, the organisation said: ""The MPAA opposes online harassment in all forms. While we agree with the aims... we are concerned that the current version of the bill is written so broadly that it could have a chilling effect on mainstream and constitutionally-protected speech."" But the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, which has campaigned for revenge porn to be made illegal, said an ""intent to harass"" provision would render the law ""incoherent"". ""It would allow people to distribute private, sexually explicit material of no public concern unless it could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that their motive was to harass,"" the organisation said in its response to the MPAA. ""The motive of a distributor has no bearing on whether the material is newsworthy or a matter of public concern.

It has been a rough ride,"" he said. But in 2015 he told researchers from the Midwest Innocence Project - a group that aids wrongly convicted prisoners - about a man called Ricky he had heard about. Mr Jones had been told by fellow inmates that he looked identical to Ricky. ""When I saw the picture of my double it all made sense to me,"" he said. Mr Jones had been convicted based mostly on eyewitness evidence. There was no physical, DNA or fingerprint evidence that linked him to the crime. The researchers found that not only did the other man bear an uncanny resemblance to Mr Jones, he lived near the scene of the crime in Kansas City, Kansas, whereas Mr Jones lived across the state line in Kansas City, Missouri.

The newly elected Liberal government has pledged to take in 25,000 refugees by the end of February. Canada's stance on the issue differs sharply to that of the US, which has been reluctant to take in migrants. Another plane is due in Montreal on Saturday. Immigration Minister John McCallum said all 10 provinces in Canada are in favour of accepting the refugees. ""This is a great moment for Canada,"" he said. ""This shows the way we really are. It truly is a non-partisan, national project."" Since early November, hundreds of Syrians have already arrived in Canada via commercial aircraft. A total of about 300 Syrians will arrive this week. The Toronto Star, the country's largest-circulation daily newspaper, ran a cover story on Thursday welcoming the refugees. The US administration has said it will take in 10,000 refugees over the next year. Some Republican governors have unsuccessfully tried to keep them from coming to their states after deadly terrorist attacks in France and California. Leading Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said after the California attacks that all Muslims should be blocked from coming to the US, drawing condemnation across the globe. Global News reporter Mike Armstrong has been taking photos of refugees at Canada's refugee processing centre in Amman, Jordan. Some families have been told they may move in weeks, he tweeted. About 800 refugees are going through screening tests in Lebanon and Jordan daily, Mr McCallum said. Mr Trudeau, who swept the 19 October Canadian elections, has a different stance on refugees from that of his predecessor, the conservative Stephen Harper, who did not wish to resettle more people. Unaccompanied men will be excluded from the resettlement programme but officials said this had nothing to do with national security concerns. ""We want them to have a roof over their head, and the right support,"" said Mr McCallum. ""It takes a bit of time to put that all in place. We're happy to take a little more time than originally planned to bring our new friends into the country.""

The announcement comes after tortuous negotiations between the two former rivals who agreed to work together following disputed elections last year. The cabinet still needs to be approved by parliament. Mr Ghani's cabinet contains three women, for the portfolios of women's affairs, culture and higher education. As widely rumoured, his new foreign minister is confirmed as Salahuddin Rabbani, son of former president Burhanuddin Rabbani who was killed by a suicide bomber in 2011. New heads for Afghanistan's National Bank and the NDS, Afghanistan's National Security Directorate, were also announced. BBC Afghan's editor in Kabul, Waheed Massoud, says almost all the cabinet are new faces. Some are hardly known to the public. Many of the new ministers are young and have not been deeply involved in the years of political fighting and war which have blighted Afghanistan's recent past, he says. ""The government will refer them to the parliament for a vote of confidence,"" Mr Ghani's chief of staff, Abdul Salam Rahimi, said. He did not say when the vote might be held. The long delay in confirming the cabinet had prompted fears that the unity government might fall apart over the issue. Mr Ghani marked his first 100 days in office last week. He was sworn in on 29 September after an election his rival accused him of winning by fraud. The United States helped broker the unity deal. Reuters news agency reports that the cabinet make-up reflects the two rival camps and contains ""prominent ethnic and regional power-brokers"". Mr Ghani's time in office has seen a surge in Taliban attacks as militants seek to exploit the vacuum in government. The president's biggest initiative has been to sign security agreements allowing US-led forces to end combat operations at the end of last year. At the start of this year, Afghan forces took over full responsibility for security. Some 13,000 mainly American soldiers remain in a training and support role, together with a few thousand US troops whose focus will be on counter-terrorist operations.","The names of 25 ministers were read out at a ceremony in Kabul presided over by Mr Ghani and government chief executive Abdullah Abdullah.

Pavlensky was arrested but released the following day and placed under travel restrictions. However, the 29-year-old now faces the charge of hooliganism. The hooliganism charge is used to prosecute perceived breaches of public order. It is the same charge used to jail members of the punk band Pussy Riot, and to prosecute activists from the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. The St Petersburg performance artist had reportedly sat for an hour and a half on the square on Sunday afternoon, with a nail driven through his genitals into the ground. His ""fixation"" act, he said, was a metaphor for apathy in Russia. Critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin accuse the veteran leader of presiding over a crackdown on dissent since his re-election in March last year. A police source told Interfax news agency that the article under which Pavlensky was being charged carried a wide range of penalties. starting with a fine and going up to a five-year prison sentence. His graphic act outside the Lenin Mausoleum was recorded on video which was put online. Timing his act to coincide with Police Day, Pavlensky said in a statement published on Sunday: ""When the authorities turn the country into one big prison, openly robbing the populace and channelling funds to increase and enrich the police and other security agencies, society accepts arbitrariness and, having forgotten its advantage in numbers, brings the triumph of the police state closer through its inaction.""

166,37560655,"A photographer who was able to board the stricken wooden vessel said more than 1,000 migrants had been crammed aboard. They were among at least 28 migrants who died in the area on Tuesday, while some 4,655 people were rescued. The total number rescued over the past two days is more than 10,000, while the death toll is at least 50. Smugglers have taken advantage of calm weather to push more boats out to sea. Aris Messinis, a photographer for the French AFP news agency, said many of the dead aboard one particular boat had suffocated. He said: ""It was a wooden vessel and there were about 1,000 people on three levels. I counted 22 bodies and there are still others in the hold."" Mr Messinis's graphic images showed the bodies of dead young men and women, piled on top of one another on the deck of a dinghy and in the cramped hold of a wooden boat. On Monday, 6,055 migrants were rescued - one of the highest numbers in a single day - and 22 found dead, Italian and Libyan officials said. One Italian ship rescued about 725 migrants from a single rubber boat, the coastguard said - just one of 20 rescue operations that day. Relatively calm weather is contributing to a surge in the number of people attempting to make the crossing before the cold weather sets in. The surge takes the number of migrants who have arrived in Italy this year to about 142,000 and the death toll to about 3,100, according to the International Organisation for Migration. The majority come from African countries, including Nigeria, Eritrea, Guinea, Gambia, Sudan, Ivory Coast and Somalia. European law says migrants must stay in the country where they first enter the EU. With fewer migrants able to travel into Europe via Greece and the Balkan route, and France, Switzerland and Austria effectively closing their borders, Italy is struggling to deal with the growing numbers landing on its shores. Monday marked three years to the day since 366 migrants died when an overcrowded boat sank off the Italian coast, in a disaster that first drew widespread attention to the plight of those attempting to reach Europe by sea.","A photographer who was able to board the stricken wooden vessel said more than 1,000 migrants had been crammed aboard.

Meg Kendal returned from her hamstring injury to make 16, sharing in a third wicket stand of 45 with Shillington, who struck four boundaries and cleared the ropes twice in an entertaining 37 from 36 balls. Both fell in quick succession and it was left to skipper Delany and Isobel Joyce (24) to rebuild the innings with a stand of 44. Having reached 106-4 with 19 overs remaining, Ireland looked set for a total approaching 200, however the innings faltered in the final third, as they slumped to 144 all out. Jahanara Alam (3-21), Panna Ghosh (2-16) and Khadija Tul Kubra (2-26) were best with the ball for Bangladesh. Ireland needed quick wickets in the Bangladesh chase, but their attack was blunted by a steady opening stand of 40 between Sharmin Sultana (22) and Sharmin Akhter. Gaby Lewis (1-31) dismissed Sultana, and when Isobel Joyce ran out Islam for 2, Ireland were back in the contest at 52-2. However Akhter hit a fine half century from 86 balls, adding 53 with Morgana Hoque, to ensure Bangladesh quickly regained control.

Speaking of potential protests, Mr Cardozo said the authorities would not tolerate violence committed by either demonstrators or the security forces. Brazil's security forces have trained for several scenarios, including chemical and biological attacks. But their main focus has been on the possibility of an extremist bomb attack similar to that at the Boston marathon in 2013, officials say. In Boston, two suspects not linked to extremist groups detonated two bombs killing three and injuring hundreds of people. The head of Brazil's counter terrorist task force Gen Julio Cesar de Arruda also thinks that the most likely terrorist attack scenario is that of a ""lone wolf"" or an extremist acting without connection to known terrorist groups. ""This is the most difficult kind of attack to track or predict,"" he told BBC Brasil. There will be more than 170,000 security personnel working on protecting the tournament in Brazil, including the police and the army. The government is also deploying 1,850 members of the special forces and 36 helicopters as part of its counter terrorism unit. National intelligence officials are reportedly also in contact with several international intelligence agencies. Last year, a leader of the Sao-Paulo-based criminal organisation, First Command of the Capital or PCC, was recorded issuing threats of kidnappings involving tourists and bomb attacks. The PCC said it would target the World Cup if its members were transferred to jails with higher security levels than the ones they are currently locked up in. The authorities think that threat has gone away after the transfer was blocked by legal action. While terrorist attacks are considered unlikely, the authorities think demonstrations are a given. At least seven different social movements have said they will protest around the time of the opening match on Thursday in several Brazilian cities. Mr Cardozo said that ""abuses of any kind would not be tolerated"". He said the federal government had asked local authorities to ensure local police officers used only a moderate amount of force.

The company said it had begun withdrawing the ad from its campaign. In an open letter addressed to the film star and published on Wednesday, a group of activists expressed ""dismay"" at the ""offensive image"". ""In the advertisement you appear to be representing aristocracy from a bygone era - bejewelled, poised and relaxing while an obviously underage slave-child, very dark and emaciated, struggles to hold an oversize umbrella over your head. ""The extremely fair colour of your skin (as projected in the advertisement) contrasted with the black skin of the slave-boy is obviously a deliberate 'creative' juxtaposition by the advertising agency, and insidiously racist.""

Several TV and projector manufacturers are promoting the new format as being ideal for 55in or bigger televisions that families can sit close to, and cinema screens. One challenge with introducing it to a handset is that higher resolutions typically take a greater toll on battery life. But Sharp promotes the Igzo (Indium gallium zinc oxide) tech used in the displays as being more energy efficient than the silicon-based LCD screens commonly used in smartphones and tablets, which should help offset their power demands. With smartphones becoming capable of filming in 4K, Mr Coulling also suggested there would be an energy trade-off that could benefit users watching back such videos. ""You will be able to show 4K content natively on the screen, which means you won't need to process it to get it to display properly.""

173,37516866,"Gwynedd council is a considering charging a premium on holiday homes. Councillor Jason Humphreys, however, fears the authority will lose out as people sidestep the charge by classing their second homes as self-catering businesses. Gwynedd said it was powerless to stop owners making the change. Some Welsh councils have voted through hikes in council tax charges for second homes, including Anglesey and Pembrokeshire, with other councils still consulting on a change. Since 2006, the number of self-catering units in Gwynedd has risen from 78 to 968. Changes to the Housing (Wales) Act 2014 mean councils have the ability to charge a premium on top of the existing council tax payments for second homes from the 2017-18 financial year. But self-catering units are classed as businesses and so their owners pay business tax to the Treasury rather than council tax. According to the law, self-catering units have to be made available for letting for 140 days a year, and owners have to prove they have been let for at least 70 days. Mr Humphreys, chairman of the council's corporate scrutiny committee, told the Post Cyntaf programme there was no mechanism for monitoring the situation. He called for AMs and MPs to demand a law change to make it compulsory for anyone seeking to reclassify their holiday home as a self-catering unit to apply for planning permission. But Peredur Jenkins, cabinet member responsible for resources, said the council had no power to stop owners from designating their properties as self-catering units. The council previously warned the potential ""loophole"" could leave authorities worse off. Mr Jenkins said Gwynedd was pressing the Welsh Government to consider changing the planning regulations to give local authorities the power to determine whether owners could re-classify their properties. The Welsh Conservatives have criticised the second home tax as an unfair ""money-spinner"", with shadow local government minister Janet Finch-Saunders calling it a ""spiteful wealth tax"".

In 2012, there were 700,000 vapers in the UK; now there are 2.9 million. The main reason ex-smokers give for vaping is to help them stop smoking.

Scientists say current evidence suggests that the risks of exposure to toxins for e-cigarette users are likely to be low - and much lower than with tobacco. Deborah Arnott, the campaigning health charity's chief executive, said the figures on vapers who had quit smoking were ""excellent news"" but that the rate of people switching to electronic versions had peaked. ""The rapid growth in e-cigarette use has come to an end,"" she said. This is because more than a third of smokers have still never tried e-cigarettes, as a result of concerns about the safety and addictiveness of e-cigarettes. But research suggests that 26% of people think e-cigarettes are more - or equally as - harmful as smoking tobacco while only 13% believe they are a lot less harmful.

175,32045560,"The Australian Crime Commission (ACC) report said the drug - known as ""ice"" - posed the highest risk to Australian communities of any illegal substance. It also found that the purity of the drug had increased over the past few years, making it even more dangerous. Methylamphetamine comes in a range of forms, with the crystal ""ice"" variety the most common in Australia. The price of crystal meth in Australia is among the highest in the world, the report found, driving the country's organised crime gangs to trade increasingly in the drug. According to the report, gangs supplying the drug were also mixing other illegal substances into crystal meth in an attempt to increase addiction levels. The ACC said there had been a ""considerable increase in the number and weight of detections at the Australian border"" without any decrease in domestic production. It said Mexican drug cartels were becomingly increasingly involved in supplying the drug abroad, working with distribution networks in other countries such as Australia. The precursor chemicals used by Australia's domestic producers to ""cook"" the drug were being increasingly imported from India and China, it found. Chris Dawson, chief executive of the ACC, said the ""availability and addictive nature"" of crystal meth had ""created new demand in urban, rural and disadvantaged communities"". ""Ice is a devastating, insidious drug. It affects everyone from users, their families, and their communities, and the authorities who deal with the users,"" he said. In November last year, New South Wales police seized more than 800 kilograms of methylamphetamine, along with two tonnes of MDMA - worth a combined estimated street value of A$1.5bn (Â£800m; $1.2m).

176,35416317,"After a dominant start from the visitors, Aberdeen exploded into life when Jonny Hayes fired home an unstoppable drive from 25 yards. Simon Church marked his debut with a goal when he bundled home from close range to make it 2-0 at Pittodrie. Leigh Griffiths pulled one back in injury time, but the Dons held on to cut the gap on Celtic to three points. It was a sensational atmosphere in this top-of-the-table clash, which saw striker Church make his debut for the hosts with Efe Ambrose taking a seat on the bench. The early exchanges were combative and committed but restricted to long-range efforts that did not threaten an opener. Celtic grew in confidence going forward during the first half, and there were strong claims for a penalty as Shay Logan was thought to have handled the ball. The contest then erupted and it was Aberdeen who decisively struck. Hayes gathered a clearance about 25 yards from goal and hit a fabulous strike which crept inside goalkeeper Craig Gordon's post. As Celtic manager Ronny Deila looked on in horror, things got worse for his side as Aberdeen roared further ahead. Hayes sent in a corner, Kenny McLean nodded on and debutant Church kneed the ball home from close range to send Pittodrie wild. McLean came close to a third just before half-time with a fierce drive from outside the box which Gordon diverted. Deila's half-time response was to hand a debut to Colin Kazim-Richards at the expense of Stuart Armstrong. However, it was Aberdeen who should have gone further ahead. Defensive indecision presented Church with a glorious chance to seal it, but he somehow screwed the ball wide from close range. Celtic struggled to create until Scott Brown hooked the ball across for Griffiths, who looked certain to bury a header back across goal, but it inched past the far post. Niall McGinn then fired from distance and Gordon cleared the ball as it looked to be heading just wide. Then Griffiths cut inside onto his left foot and fired past Scott Brown to pull one back for Celtic in stoppage time, but there was not enough time left to search for an equaliser.","After a dominant start from the visitors, Aberdeen exploded into life when Jonny Hayes fired home an unstoppable drive from 25 yards.

But, arguing the government's case, Mr Wright said Article 50 was available to ""to give effect to the will of the people"", as expressed in June's referendum, in which a majority of voters backed Brexit. The use of the royal prerogative - powers historically held by the Crown but these days passed on to ministers - was ""wholly within the expectation of Parliament"", he said.

They say the confusion may lie in the way the brain receives information from different parts of the body. Distorted perception may dominate in some people, leading to body image problems, a US journal reports. Lead researcher Dr Matthew Longo said: ""These findings may well be relevant to psychiatric conditions involving body image such as anorexia nervosa, as there may be a general bias towards perceiving the body to be wider than it is. ""Our results show dramatic distortions of hand shape, which were highly consistent across participants."" In the study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Dr Longo's team asked 18 volunteers to take part in an experiment. The volunteers were asked to put their left hands palm down under a board and judge the location of the covered hand's knuckles and fingertips with a pointer. This revealed striking distortions - the volunteers tended to misjudge their hands as wider and their fingers as shorter than they actually were. The researchers say the distortions are subconscious and involve the ability known as position sense that the brain uses to know where all parts of the body are in space even when the eyes are closed. Dr Longo said: ""Of course we know what our hand really looks like, and our participants were very accurate picking out a photo of their own hand from a set of photos with various distortions of hand shape. ""So there is clearly a conscious visual image of the body as well. But that visual image seems not to be used for position sense."" Susan Ringwood, chief executive of the eating disorders charity Beat, said: ""We know that one of the features of anorexia nervosa can be distorted body image.

Andrzej Zawistowski, director of the IPN's education department, said the plan includes 229 monuments that refer to ""what we consider as untruth: gratitude for having given Poland independence."" Poland, now a western ally and Nato member, sees the Soviet domination following the end of the war as a period of oppression, and its relations with Moscow have been strained for some years. Poland and Russia are loggerheads over a number of issues, notably Russia's policy on Ukraine and EU sanctions on Moscow. The plan is diplomatically sensitive. The Kremlin protested strongly when a Soviet monument was removed from the town of Pieniezno last year. Russia says it exposed a lack of gratitude for the sacrifice of the Soviet troops who freed Poland from the Nazis. More than 20 million Soviet soldiers died in World War Two. Moscow argues that Poland is obliged to protect all war memorials under a 1994 bilateral agreement with Russia. But Poland says the agreement covers only cemeteries, which are not affected under the plan.

187,38995175,"An Â£8m scheme has been unveiled for the home, where Lennon played as a child. The venture will combine an education centre for young people with learning difficulties and an exhibition on the home, the song and Lennon's early life. The gates at the site, which is closed to the public, are a popular attraction for Beatles fans visiting Liverpool. The plans were announced on the 50th anniversary of the release of the single, which was a double-A side with Penny Lane, reaching number two in the UK charts and number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the USA. The original home in Woolton was demolished in the early 1970s and replaced with a smaller building. Major Drew McCombe, divisional leader for the North West branch of the charity, said: ""Strawberry Field is special in the hearts of many people in Liverpool, the UK and across the world, and we at the Salvation Army are aiming to redevelop the site to do justice to the many people that have been supported by the children's home or formed a connection with the iconic Beatles song."" According to Blue Badge Beatles tour guide Neil McDonald, the gates are one of the must-see Beatles sights in the city. He said: ""It is a unique atmosphere. I've seen some people burst into tears and even proposals of marriage."" According to Hunter Davies's biography of The Beatles, one of Lennon's childhood treats was the garden party that took place each summer on the grounds of Strawberry Field. His Aunt Mimi recalled: ""As soon as we could hear the Salvation Army band starting, John would jump up and down shouting 'Mimi, come on. We're going to be late.'"" The musician is said to have found a place of peace and refuge from his troubled childhood in the woods around the home, where he went to play with friends, climb trees and dream the hours away. The song's refrain ""and nothing to get hung about"" is said to be a reference to Lennon's retort ""they can't hang you for it"" to Mimi about playing on the property. Official fundraising for the project begins later this year.","An £8m scheme has been unveiled for the home, where Lennon played as a child.

In a blogpost, Mr Krebs detailed the attack, which began late on Tuesday night and quickly ramped up to its peak attack rate.

""It was among the biggest assaults the internet has ever witnessed,"" added Mr Krebs. Security firm Akamai said the attack generated such a huge volume of data by exploiting weak or default passwords in widely used net-connected cameras, routers and digital video recorders. Once in control of these ""smart"" devices the attackers used them to swamp the site with data requests. ""These new internet-accessible devices can bring great benefits, but they are also an increasingly easy and lucrative targets for cybercriminals,"" said Nick Shaw from security firm Symantec. The security firm has carried out research which shows swift growth in the number of malware families scouring the net for vulnerable devices. Typically, said Mr Shaw, malicious hackers who take over gadgets are not interested in stealing personal data. ""Cybercriminals are interested in cheap bandwidth to enable bigger attacks,"" he said. Mr Krebs speculated that the attack could have been prompted by an article he published, in early September, that named two young men allegedly associated with a service called vDos that carried out DDoS attacks for cash.

Monday's 7% plunge in the Shanghai market, which led to the suspension of trading for the first time, triggered a global equities rout. But a sense of calm has now moved over financial markets, said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at trading firm IG in a note.

A footbridge which crosses Leith Street is being removed as part of the project but the council, which owns the bridge, plans to store it and try to ""recycle"" it in a new location. The development, which will keep the existing John Lewis store, will also include a cinema, which is expected to offer more art house films than the Vue multiplex at the nearby Omni centre. Edinburgh St James is a 1.7 million sq ft city centre development and one of the biggest regeneration projects currently underway in the UK.

192,34676512,"Jobs Growth Wales helps firms employ 16-24 year olds for six months by covering the cost of the minimum wage. The Tories aim to replace it with a scheme called Journeys to Work, open to all ages, with jobs lasting for a year. Deputy Skills Minister Julie James claimed it was a ""ringing endorsement"" of Jobs Growth Wales, saying a new scheme was planned for all adults. Labour has hailed Jobs Growth Wales - which is part funded with EU money - a big success that has exceeded its targets on the number of jobs created. However, a review in 2014 found nearly three-quarters of participants would have found work anyway. In July, a committee of assembly members urged ministers to consider designing a similar scheme for the over-50s. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""Labour's age cap on job creation offers nothing to the many thousands of over-25s that want to get on and build a career for themselves. ""Not only does this sell hardworking people short, it's contributing to the acute skills shortage which is holding the Welsh economy back."" The party said it would work with employers to make sure the jobs created lasted longer. But with no extra funding, the money spent on each job would be cut from the current average of Â£4,211 to Â£3,000. The announcement is part of a set of policies the Tories call Stronger Futures Cymru. They say they would work with businesses, schools and colleges to promote apprenticeships to students, and encourage schools to forge closer links with businesses in their communities. Responding for the Welsh government, Ms James said: ""They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and I welcome this ringing endorsement of our flagship skills policies. ""It is particularly pleasing that they are so popular that the opposition seek not only to continue them, but to extend them too."" Ms James also confirmed plans to introduce a new scheme - Skills for Employment Wales - in April 2016 which would be open to all adults looking for work.

She was seen as an Abe protÃ©gÃ©, sharing his staunchly nationalist views. Her resignation comes as the prime minister sees a sharp plunge in public support over alleged cronyism. The 58-year-old Mrs Inada had already been widely expected to be replaced in a cabinet reshuffle next week that the prime minister hopes will help rebuild his ratings. The row over the South Sudan peacekeeping mission erupted in December when the defence ministry said peacekeepers' logs for July, when the security situation there was worsening, had been discarded. But two months later officials said they had found the data on a computer, leading to allegations that the logs had been withheld on purpose. Peacekeeping missions are controversial in Japan, which has a pacifist constitution. Japanese peacekeepers are only deployed under strict conditions, including that a cease-fire must be in place. Any change in the security situation in South Sudan could have affected whether the mission would continue. Mrs Inada was appointed defence minister in 2016. But her months in the position have seen a series of gaffes. She particularly came under fire for suggesting in a speech that the military wanted voters to back the ruling party. Mr Abe apologised to the country on Friday immediately after Mrs Inada's resignation. He also said that for the time being, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida would add the defence portfolio to his duties. In his years in power, Mr Abe has taken the controversial position that nation needs to change the pacifist constitution to formalise the existence of the military. Japan is highly divided on the issue and claims the defence ministry has not been transparent over the South Sudan deployment will likely fuel public scepticism. The prime minister is also facing plummeting support amid two patronage scandals. He denies wrongdoing, but his approval ratings have fallen below 30% according to recent polls.

They also want the end of what they see as discrimination in the areas of salaries, housing and health care. President Morales, himself an Aymara, called for ""discipline"" within the forces. ""We are talking about armed forces that are ready to defend our homeland. If there is no discipline, there are no armed forces in Bolivia,"" he told a news conference in La Paz. But another protest leader, Marcela Shiriqui, accused him of ""only listening to military leaders"". ""All we have done is to ask for equal treatment within the forces and an end to discrimination. We will continue with our protest,"" she told Bolivia's Erbol radio station. The military rejected what it called an ""excuse"". ""Discrimination is not an excuse for sedition and to orchestrate a coup d'etat,"" Chief of Armed Forces Victor Baldivieso told Bolivia's state-owned Abi news agency. On Wednesday, Defence Minister Ruben Saavedra said the country's armed forces were changing and that in 2015 enlisted soldiers and sergeants would be able to receive scholarships to study to become officers.

Although abortion it is not currently illegal on the island, the law states the procedure can only be carried out in the event of a criminal offence or on mental health grounds.

However, while most women from the UK can have an NHS-funded abortion, those from the island have to pay for both the procedure and travel expenses. BPAS spokesman Katherine O'Brien told the BBC that there are many who cannot afford to make the journey and are ""increasingly resorting to buying medication online.""

Councillor Bill Lobban wants an investigation to check for a link between the water and skin complaints. Scottish Water said it would look at enhancements to the treatment process. There have been complaints about the water's taste since the supply came on stream four years ago. A public meeting in Kincraig, near Aviemore, on Tuesday, which representatives from Scottish Water attended, heard from consumers who believe the water has aggravated skin conditions. After the meeting, Highland councillor Mr Lobban said skin complaints did appear to be on the rise in the area. He told BBC Radio Scotland: ""I am not a doctor or a scientist so I cannot tell if it is directly attributable to the water or not, but it is something that requires serious investigating. ""It should not be a question of Scottish Water saying basically 'this is a medical problem, go to your doctor'. ""This should be more about Scottish Water liaising with NHS Highland to find out if there potentially is a problem or not."" Scottish Water said it already worked closely with health authorities, including NHS Highland. A spokesman said: ""If a health authority has any concerns over the safety of a water supply, it can impose restrictions on water use, until such times as the matter is investigated and dealt with. ""No restrictions have been imposed in this area and we can reassure customers the water is absolutely safe to use."" The spokesman said the company recognised that ""a small number of customers in the Aviemore area"" have found the water is not to their taste. He said: ""We want everyone to enjoy the look and taste of their water and continue to liaise closely with the local community, as we work to resolve their concerns. ""That's why we are proposing further enhancements to the treatment processes we use, and are proposing switching to a process called chloramination.

Culture minister Ed Vaizey put an export bar on it until 30 September. After worldwide donations the museum has since raised enough money to buy the ring and its bid has been accepted. Contributions to the Bring the Ring Home campaign, set up by the museum in Jane Austen's former home, included an anonymous donation of £100,000 in August. The museum, in Chawton, Hampshire, was given until December to raise a further £49,000. Mary Guyatt, curator of the museum, said it had been ""stunned by the generosity and light-footedness"" of those who had supported the bid. Mr Vaizey added: ""It's clear from the number of people who gave generously to the campaign just how admired Jane Austen remains to this day."" The museum already displays two other pieces of jewellery owned by the writer - a turquoise bracelet and a topaz cross. The ring is accompanied by papers documenting its history within the author's family. It passed first to her sister Cassandra, who then gave it to her sister-in-law Eleanor Austen on her engagement to Jane and Cassandra's brother, the Reverend Henry Thomas Austen. It remained in the family until Clarkson bought it at auction. The ring will now go on display at the museum in the New Year. On hearing the museum had been successful in raising funds to purchase the ring, Ms Clarkson said: ""The ring is a beautiful national treasure and I am happy to know that so many Jane Austen fans will get to see it at Jane Austen's House Museum."" The museum said it hoped to welcome Ms Clarkson there in the future. Austen, who lived most of her life in Hampshire, is one of English literature's most celebrated authors.

202,34650122,"In 2014/15 just over 48% of babies were being breastfed at the time of the first child health review visit at about 10 days old. The figures have been published by ISD Scotland. They showed a rise in the number of babies fed a mix of both breast and formula milk since 2005/06. Earlier this year the Scottish government hosted a summit aimed at encouraging more mothers to breastfeed their babies. The report from ISD Scotland, which compiles health statistics for the government, looked at rates for babies born in the last financial year. It said there is good evidence that breastfeeding in infancy has a protective effect against many childhood illnesses. It said breastfed infants were also likely to have a reduced risk of infection while other probable benefits included improved cognitive and psychological development, and a reduced risk of childhood obesity. Reporting its key findings, the publication concluded: ""Across Scotland, the overall breastfeeding rate has remained at a broadly similar level over the last decade."" In 2014/15, 48.3% of babies were breastfed at the first visit review. This rate included 35.2% of babies who were exclusively breastfed and 13.1% who were fed both breast and formula milk. This compares with the figures for a decade ago when 38.3% were exclusively breastfed and 6.4% were mixed fed. The statistics for last year also showed that by the time of the six to eight week health review the breasting rate had fallen to 38%. The World Health Organization recommends all children are exclusively breastfed up to six months, and breastfeeding alongside other appropriate foods continues up to and beyond two years. In other findings, the report highlighted a ""clear association"" between low levels of breastfeeding and deprivation. Mothers in the least deprived areas were nearly three times as likely to breastfeed exclusively at six to eight weeks compared with mothers in the most deprived areas. But there has been an increase over the last decade in overall breastfeeding rates in the most deprived areas at the first visit from 26% to nearly 33%, the statistics showed. Researchers also found that mothers who did not smoke were about three times more likely to breastfeed than smokers. Breastfeeding rates were also found to vary by geographical area in 2014/15. Exclusive breastfeeding rates ranged from 24.3% in NHS Lanarkshire to 59.4% in NHS Shetland, for example.","In 2014/15 just over 48% of babies were being breastfed at the time of the first child health review visit at about 10 days old.

This latest search began in a forest at Pont-de-l'Arche after new information on the whereabouts of Mr Ruddy was passed to the ICLVR from the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP). The group has close links to the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), which killed Mr Ruddy. Sources in the IRSP claim Mr Ruddy went willingly with INLA members from Paris to the wooded area, where there was an arms dump. What happened among the group is not clear but Mr Ruddy was shot dead. He was buried in a shallow grave. Sources claim that INLA members returned to the spot the following day, removed the arms cache and buried Mr Ruddy where it had been been. It is understood that former INLA and IRSP members travelled to northern France last year to try to pinpoint the spot where the Newry man was buried. Ms Morgan has said she knows the names of the people who killed her brother.

More on this story and other news from London The court previously heard claims police gave Mr Cipriani special treatment and delayed breathalysing him in a move the rugby player believed was ""calculated to assist him"". Mr Cipriani was breathalysed after crashing his Mercedes into a taxi and found to have 67 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath - nearly twice the drink-drive limit in England and Wales of 35 micrograms. But Sgt Peacock said delays are common, particularly at shift changeover, as was the case when Mr Cipriani was brought in. He also said the sports star was kept outside in a part of the station precinct known as ""the cage"" in order to stop other detainees recognising him.

Mr Mugadza of the Remnant Church held a press conference last week at which he announced his prophecy of Mr Mugabe's forthcoming demise. He was arrested at the magistrate's court in Harare where he was appearing on separate charges of wearing the national flag. This was made an offence last year, after another Pastor, Evan Mawarire, launched a campaign urging Zimbabweans to reclaim their flag. This is not Pastor Mugadza's first brush with the law. In 2005, he was arrested and detained for nearly a month after holding a placard telling Mr Mugabe his people were suffering under his rule.

""Everyone has the power to intervene and get help. These actions can save lives."" In the aftermath of the 2012 shooting, Barack Obama called for action on gun control, despite the political difficulties. But three years later, he called gun control the greatest frustration of his presidency, as the US Congress repeatedly blocked moves to tighten restrictions. The gun control movement reached a peak in the summer when more than 200 Democratic politicians staged a sit-in at the House of Representatives to demand a vote on restricting firearm purchases, in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida. The Gun Violence Archive non-profit organisation maintains a ""mass shooting tracker"" of attacks where four or more people were shot in a single incident. It estimates that so far in 2016, 425 people have been killed in 362 mass shootings in the United States. It says there were 333 mass shootings last year, and 275 two years ago.

The freezing of the travel ban was announced by the director of East Libya's civil society commission, Abir Mneina, who had held talks with the military chief of staff of Libya's eastern region, Abdelrazzak al-Naduri, on Tuesday. She told the BBC that officials had been asked to cancel the ban but agreed only to freeze it temporarily and carry out a review. ""He [Mr al-Naduri] said... there are security implications that need to be considered. We said fine, if there are specific security issues then we understand and support that because we are in a state of war and this is an important matter for us all,"" said Ms Mneina ""So that's why we finally agreed that the directive will be reviewed to ensure that there are no violations against rights and freedomsâ€¦ Our main aim is to get the order cancelled completely.

Co-owner Tal Landsman, who is on trial accused of child cruelty, did nothing when he was informed, jurors at St Albans Crown Court heard. Mr Landsman, 26, denies one charge of cruelty to a person under 16. He is accused of the offence between 31 July and 7 August 2015. Prosecutor Ann Evans told the jury Lewis had pleaded guilty to possessing indecent images. Lewis has admitted three counts of making indecent images and one of taking indecent images. On the first day of Mr Landsman's trial, LL Camps worker Sandra Vicente told the court Lewis, 26, had given her his phone and PIN so she could play music at a children's party on 1 August. Afterwards, a colleague asked to look at some photos Lewis had taken of him, but she then clicked on the deleted images. She first saw pictures of small children, naked and on a beach, and then saw some taken in a ""changing room"". ""I would say they were aged three to four,"" she said. ""I felt my brain was polluted. I felt sick."" That night she said she told Mr Landsman, of Crambus Court, Admiral Drive, Stevenage. The prosecution alleges Mr Landsman, who was one of the camp's safeguarding officers, did nothing and allowed his friend to keep working. She called the police three days later after Lewis came to her with a three-year-old girl, who he said he had found in the toilets and had wet herself. The prosecution told the jury when Ms Vicente spoke to Mr Landsman he said would sort it and she should not tell anyone. Later that night Mr Landsman messaged her and asked if a ""million per cent categorically"" the picture she had seen was taken in the camp's changing rooms and she replied, ""Yeah"".

214,33052091,"The recipient, Wolfang Rangger, who lost his right leg in 2007, said: ""It feels like I have a foot again. It's like a second lease of life."" Prof Hubert Egger of the University of Linz, said sensors fitted to the sole of the artificial foot, stimulated nerves at the base of the stump. He added it was the first time that a leg amputee had been fitted with a sensory-enhanced prosthesis. Surgeons first rewired nerve endings in the patient's stump to place them close to the skin surface. Six sensors were fitted to the base of the foot, to measure the pressure of heel, toe and foot movement. These signals were relayed to a micro-controller which relayed them to stimulators inside the shaft where it touched the base of the stump. These vibrated, stimulating the nerve endings under the skin, which relayed the signals to the brain. Prof Egger said: ""The sensors tell the brain there is a foot and the wearer has the impression that it rolls off the ground when he walks."" Wolfgang Ranger, a former teacher, who lost his leg after a blood clot caused by a stroke, has been testing the device for six months, both in the lab and at home. He said: ""I no longer slip on ice and I can tell whether I walk on gravel, concrete, grass or sand. I can even feel small stones."" The 54-year-old also runs, cycles and goes climbing. Another major benefit was a reduction in excruciating ""phantom limb"" pain felt by Mr Rangger for years following the amputation. Prof Egger said the brain now received real data rather than searching for information from the missing limb. The Austrian research team unveiled their results at a press conference in Vienna. But they have yet to publish details in a medical journal. Last year an international team created a bionic hand which allows the amputee to feel sensations from their fingers. Their study was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Dr Alastair Ritchie, lecturer in Biomaterials and Bioengineering, University of Nottingham, said the Austrian announcement was exciting but not as groundbreaking as the work already done for the arm and hand.","The recipient, Wolfang Rangger, who lost his right leg in 2007, said: ""It feels like I have a foot again.

217,35596495,"Kim Eacott's terrier, Scally, had ""separation anxiety"" and would bark constantly at her Hereford cottage. Angela Waring, of Crickhowell, Powys, was held jointly responsible by a judge in the noise nuisance complaint as she owned the home. She has contested the decision at London's Appeal Court, which will make a ruling at a later date. Mrs Waring paid for her daughter's cottage despite the pair having fallen out. The court heard Scally barked incessantly when Miss Eacott was not at home in 2011 and 2012, prompting neighbours Bryn and Diane Cocking to file a claim the noise was ""unreasonable in its frequency and duration"". Mrs Waring said she offered to take Scally to a ""dog whisperer"" to try to calm him down, despite not being on speaking terms with her daughter. In Worcester County Court in 2013, judge Daniel Pearce-Higgins upheld the Cockings' noise nuisance claim. Miss Eacott was ordered to pay £3,500 in damages and her mother £1,000. Both were hit with a £31,000 legal costs bill. Mrs Waring has asked the court to rule that she was not responsible for her daughter, so should not have to pay for her failing to control Scally. Hamish MacBean, for Mrs Waring, said she had done her best to defuse the row and wrote to her daughter, telling her: ""If Scally barks when you are not there, there is a dog whisperer in Abergavenny who can cure him in a gentle way."" The court heard their relationship was so strained Mrs Waring had been advised by police not to talk to her daughter following a harassment complaint. Catherine Doran, for the Cockings, said: ""Were it not for Mrs Waring's failure to abate the nuisance, Mr and Mrs Cocking would not have had to issue a claim at all.""

218,36110880,"So-called mathematics anxiety was found especially in countries which were more developed and where males and females were considered more or less equal. University of Glasgow researchers looked at achievements, attitudes and emotions around maths and found girls showed more negative emotion about it. Data was collected from 500,000 15-year-olds in 68 countries. Mathematics anxiety is defined as ""negative feelings experienced during the preparation of and engagement in maths activities"". Academics, led by Dr Gijsbert Stoet, from Glasgow University's school of education, said it did not seem to matter whether the girls' mothers worked in related fields and that efforts to attract more women into science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects had largely failed. Dr Liberty Vittert, a lecturer at the School of Maths and Statistics at University of Glasgow, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that mathematics anxiety could hamper future job prospects. Dr Vittert said: ""When I was about 14, I had a maths teacher who called my parents into school to say that I couldn't do maths and I should stop and there was no point in further continuing with it. ""It really stops you with jobs if you stop with maths young. ""So I pushed through and I had an undergrad in pure mathematics from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and now I have my Phd. So I think it's very important, but I think there's a lot of pressure on young girls to not do some subjects."" Asked if maths had caused her anxiety at school, she said: ""Absolutely. I think when you have teachers or other authority figures telling you that you can't do something, of course it creates huge anxiety. ""And clearly there are pressures on a young girl not to do these things."" She added: ""If you think about maths, there is always a right or a wrong answer. Whereas in some subjects such as English, there aren't always right or wrong answers. ""So if you can't get that exact answer, the teacher can just say, 'Well you don't know what you're doing, you're not smart.' ""Whereas maybe you just don't quite get it.

The large coastal cave complex near Durness in Sutherland had been on a ""bucket list"" of places the Australian couple wanted to visit. Anna and Terry have asked for their surnames to be kept out of the public domain because of the media attention their engagement has attracted since telling family and friends. While Terry proposed to his girlfriend back in November last year, it has only now started to gain worldwide interest from news websites and magazines. Terry made the necklace from Tasmanian Huon pine and the inside of a sea shell. It was hollow inside and this was where the ring was hidden. He gave the necklace to Anna as a gift to mark the first anniversary of their relationship. Terry said: ""She wore it every day and everywhere we went, and pretty much never took it off. ""There were some occasions where I was really worried. ""At one point, I thought she was going to trade it with a blacksmith at a market - the blacksmith loved the necklace, and she loved the blacksmith's work - but luckily I didn't need to crash tackle her. ""My biggest moment of panic was when we went through airport security the first time. I hadn't thought about the fact that she might be asked to put it through the x-ray, which could have very quickly turned into an airport security proposal."" When they finally visited Smoo Cave, Terry came up with a story to get Anna to take the necklace off and break the pendant open to reveal the ring. Terry said: ""She stood there dazed for a second, trying to work out what was going on, and then it dawned and she said 'yes' with all the excitement in the world. ""After she calmed down she suddenly stopped moving, stared at me and said: 'Wait... it's been in there the entire time?!! I could have lost it you idiot'.

221,34486833,"Janet Norridge, 34, was reported to Cardiff Prison governors after being spotted in the crowd by a colleague at the 2011 tournament event. The inquest in Newport heard she was suspended from work and took her own life after losing an appeal. The hearing was told her parents later won an employment tribunal. A coroner is writing to the director of Her Majesty's Prison Service demanding a review of the way officers are treated during disciplinary proceedings. The inquest heard Ms Norridge had ambitions of becoming a prison governor but was hit by a health scare - a relative had died of bowel cancer and she tested positive for a gene which gave her an 80 per cent chance of also getting the disease. The inquest was told she went to the doctor and was given three weeks off work to come to terms with the shock. But Ms Norridge went out with friends to see a live TV screening at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff of a 2011 Rugby World Cup match where she was seen by the colleague. Friend Rebecca Rolls told the inquest: ""She was interviewed by her employers who charged her with misconduct and lost her job. ""This destroyed Janet. She was so proud of her job and her profession."" Ms Norridge's mother Joanne said her daughter was ""right in her feeling that she was unfairly dismissed"" and that she suffered ""unbelievable cruelty"" by the prison authorities. An employment tribunal in London two years later found in favour of Mrs Norridge and her husband John, ruling that prison officials had made an error in law by sacking their daughter, the inquest was told. Gwent coroner David Bowen, returning a conclusion of suicide, said: ""The tribunal ruled her dismissal was unfair however at the time of her death that ruling was in the future and not known to her.

Returning a narrative verdict, a jury spokesman said the force had failed to recognise ""that you don't need a named perpetrator and named victim for there to be a threat to life"". Mr Morgan, who was a member of the Lambeth GAS gang, was killed in a car crash. His mother had asked police to attend the funeral because it was in a patch controlled by two rival gangs, the Peckham Young Guns and the Peckham Boys. His friend Mr Khan was in Forest Hill Road outside Camberwell Old Cemetery when he was caught in an exchange of gunfire. The killers have not been found. The jury spokesman said: ""If all relevant information regarding the funeral and gang activities were linked, the Metropolitan Police Service would have put in place a different policing plan, raising the level to either a higher risk or critical. ""If there was a visible police presence at or in the vicinity of the burial service, it may have deterred gang members."" He said communication errors were ""prevalent"" and officers failed to liaise with each other to carry out their policing plan. Coroner Andrew Harris said he could find no systemic failings in the Met's intelligence gathering systems, but he did question its policy on threat to life. He said: ""I'm not clear that we can be confident that the Met Police has addressed this policy, and that is a considerable concern. ""Given the level of violence in this borough, I can't be satisfied that this has been dealt with."" A Met spokeswoman said it acknowledged the jury's findings.

Ian Murphy, from Merseyside Maritime Museum, said: ""In 1915, Lusitania was the world's most famous ship and the jewel in Liverpool's crown. ""Her sinking sent shockwaves around the globe and was said to have influenced America's entry to the war."" About 600 people onboard the Lusitania had links with Merseyside. The Reverend Dr Crispin Pailing, rector of Liverpool, said: ""A significant number of the crew and passengers had Liverpool connections - there is hardly a street in the Vauxhall area that wasn't affected.""

She served as first lady of California during her husband's stint as California governor from 1967 to 1975 before moving into the White House after his decisive victory over Democrat President Jimmy Carter in 1980. As first lady, she sought to emulate the style of one of her predecessors, Jackie Kennedy. To this end, she extensively redecorated the White House, and accepted designer dresses worth $1m (Â£703,000) and a 4,732-piece set of china worth $209,000. But this spending spree provoked an outcry from some outraged by what they saw as profligacy and waste while millions of Americans were losing their jobs. Public opinion was also swayed by accusations that Mrs Reagan had a frosty personality, often consulted astrologers, and ordered the dismissal of White House chief of staff Donald Regan in 1987. ""I see the first lady as another means to keep a president from becoming isolated,"" she once said. Mrs Reagan's best-known project as first lady was the anti-drugs ""Just Say No"" campaign. After her husband died of Alzheimer's disease in 2004, she became a champion for Alzheimer's patients, raising millions of dollars for research and breaking with fellow conservative Republicans to argue for stem cell research.","Members of the armed services accompanied the hearse as it arrived at the library in the Simi Valley city. The funeral takes place on Friday. Nancy Reagan died at the age of 94 last Sunday. Her 52-year marriage to Ronald Reagan was once described as the US presidency's greatest love affair. Mrs Reagan, who died of congestive heart failure in Los Angeles, was praised by President Barack Obama's family and other senior US politicians and foreign leaders. From 1981-89 she was one of the most influential first ladies in US history, initially criticised for an expensive renovation of the White House, by accusations that Mrs Reagan had a frosty personality, often consulted astrologers, and ordered the dismissal of White House chief of staff Donald Regan in 1987.

James Kettleborough (52 not out) and Colin Ingram (42 not out) halted Kent's victory march with a stand of 78 after Glamorgan again lost early wickets. Earlier Kent had cruised to 451-2 before declaring just after lunch on day three, with Rob Key hitting 158 and Joe Denly making 161 not out. The target of 554 left Glamorgan needing far in excess of their previous best fourth-innings championship chase of 367. Stand-in skipper Wallace welcomed Kettleborough's highest score for the club after being out of the championship side since May. ""Ketts's performances for us in the first-class game this year have shown he's got the ability to be a first-class opener,"" Wallace told BBC Wales Sport.

Ankara summoned the Chinese ambassador last week over reports that Beijing had banned Uighurs from fasting and worship during the holy month. Hundreds have died in violent attacks in Xinjiang in recent years. China blames the violence on Islamist terrorist groups but Uighur groups say the unrest is being fuelled by Beijing's repressive policies. On Sunday, protesters at the Chinese consulate were pictured burning the Chinese flag and holding banners, one of which said ""Turkey save your Brother - China get out from East Turkestan"". China crushed the short-lived state of East Turkestan in 1949. It established the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in 1955. The Chinese foreign ministry said there had recently been ""multiple"" demonstrations in Turkey targeting the Chinese government and ""several"" Chinese tourists had been attacked. Turkish media reported a group of Korean tourists believed to be Chinese were attacked and tear gas was used by police to disperse protesters. The last year has seen a crackdown in Xinjiang on what China describes as ""terrorism driven by religious extremism"". In some places, the government has banned Uighurs from buying knives and women from wearing veils. Security check points have been set up on roads and near markets and shopping malls.

A Brazilian investment fund that owned 40% of Neymar's sports rights argues it was deprived of its full share. In previous interviews, Neymar, 24, has denied any wrongdoing. Barcelona said it paid €57m (£43m) for Neymar in 2013, with the player's parents, Neymar da Silva Santos and Nadine Goncalves da Silva Santos, receiving €40m and his former club, Santos, €17m. But investigators say the fee was closer to €83m and Barcelona concealed part of the deal. The club also denies any wrongdoing. The Brazilian third-party investment fund, DIS, alleges it was financially harmed by the transfer when it received €6.8m of Santos's €17m fee and argues it was deprived of its full share. Neymar and his parents, along with Barcelona's ex-President Sandro Rosell and President Josep Maria Bartomeu, had all given statements at an earlier court hearing in February. Speaking to O Globo TV in Brazil in February, Neymar said: ""Before saying nonsense - that we hid this, or hid that - they should prove it. ""My father is doing everything to ensure that I can just focus on playing football. He handles the books. But in the moment when you see someone you love suffering, it starts to hurt."" Neymar and his father also face accusations in a separate case of defrauding the Spanish tax office, while the player faces a tax evasion investigation in Brazil. He denies wrongdoing. Neymar's move to Barcelona FC has been a big success on the pitch. The striker became part of a goal-scoring trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. In 2015, Neymar helped the club win five trophies and came third in the Fifa Ballon d'Or competition. He also scored in the Uefa Champions League final against Juventus.

The governor also reiterated he saw ""signs of growing uncertainty about the UK's macroeconomic outlook related to the referendum"". There is the possibility that a vote to leave the EU would ""reinforce existing vulnerabilities"" in the UK economy, including a risk around the UK's trade deficit, he added. ""I think it's safe to say that it [the UK current account deficit] is running at a rate around 5%... and that is remarkably high for a large advanced economy...

Derry did improve before half-time with Patterson wasting two good chances and impressive Harps keeper Ciaran Gallagher also denying Ronan Curtis. As Harps retreated into a defensive shell in the second half, Derry dominated possession but they needed the introduction of youngster Daniels to finally breach their visitors.

Youngster Daniels then set up Patterson to strike Derry ahead four minutes later with the shot appearing to take a slight deflection.

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Llewellyn went on to dump the bike and said he was in Scotland at the time. The court heard Tye was crossing the road with his mother from behind a school bus when he was hit by Llewellyn's 600cc Suzuki motorcycle. Llewellyn failed to stop and drove 11 miles (18km) away before ditching the bike and hiring a car to get away. When he was eventually traced two weeks later, he denied any involvement and claimed to have been in Scotland at the time. The court heard another man was arrested as part of the investigation as a result of the false information he gave police. He eventually admitted owning the motorcycle but claimed he had sold it, before later admitting his part in the crash. The court heard Tye suffered a blunt head injury which caused bruising to his brain, along with other fractures and lacerations. He spent 17 days in intensive care and is preparing to spend three months at a specialist brain injury recovery centre in Surrey, which it is hoped will help him regain movement. In a victim impact statement, his mother Clair told the court the months since the crash had been ""the worst of my life"". ""Seeing him struck has haunted me.

He left in 1983, two years after McLaren was taken over by current boss Ron Dennis, but returned in 1989 and worked there until he retired in 2008. ""Tyler was one of the first pillars of our company,"" said Dennis. ""Bruce couldn't have asked for a sturdier pair of shoulders upon which to help build the team's reputation. Quite simply, Tyler lived and breathed McLaren."" In the early years of the team, Alexander worked alongside Bruce McLaren and fellow American Teddy Mayer in F1, first as chief mechanic and then chief engineer before becoming a director of the company. The company continued under Mayer following McLaren's death in a testing crash in 1970. In the late 1960s, Alexander moved to run the company's successful programmes in the US, first in the CanAm sportscar championship and then in Indycar racing, before returning to F1 in 1979. Dennis took over McLaren in 1981, first running it alongside Mayer before taking total control, and two years later Alexander sold his shares to Dennis and left the company. He returned to the US to join Mayer in running an Indycar team, which recruited as engineer a young Adrian Newey, now Red Bull's chief technical officer and the most decorated design engineer in F1 with world titles at Williams, McLaren and Red Bull. Alexander and Mayer were the joint team principals of the short-lived US-based F1 team Beatrice in 1985 and 1986. After its collapse, Alexander returned to Indycar racing before Dennis re-signed him as McLaren's special projects engineer in 1989. During his final 20 years with the company, McLaren won six drivers' and five constructors' world titles with Ayrton Senna, Mika Hakkinen and Lewis Hamilton. In a tribute to Alexander on the McLaren website, Dennis said: ""Tyler was one of the finest of the old school: hardy, humble and wise, leaving a reputation and a legacy that will remain indelible in the history of international motorsport.""","Alexander was centrally involved at McLaren for more than 40 years after being recruited by driver Bruce McLaren to help set up the team in 1963.

The 46-year-old suffered chronic kidney disease since birth and was on the verge of needing dialysis treatment. Mr Clewes and Ms Crowther, 45, are now planning ""a curry and a few beers"" to celebrate the successful procedure, which was carried out in January. ""I've just got so much more energy now,"" Mr Clewes, a radio DJ from Crewe, Cheshire, said. ""There was a time when I could sleep 23-hour days, but now I struggle to get myself off to bed. ""It's hard to describe how it feels. Every now and then you remember how lucky you are to have your mate's kidney."" Mr Clewes said the pair would like to get involved in charity work to support others in need of transplants - and may even take on an extreme challenge. ""There are a few organisations who do skydives and things like that, and I've never done something like that before,"" he said. ""I think it's something I'd like to look at once I'm fully recovered."" Although his strength has returned, Mr Clewes will continue to need regular check-ups and medication to prevent his body rejecting the organ. But he added: ""I'm feeling great. I'm exercising.

A statement said voting would take place in the three provinces that make up the region, and ""areas of Kurdistan outside the region's administration"". There was no immediate comment from Iraq's central government, but it has urged Kurds not to hold a referendum. Moves towards outright independence have historically been opposed by the governments of neighbouring Iran, Turkey and Syria, as well as by the US. In April, senior Kurdish official Hoshyar Zebari told Reuters news agency that a ""yes"" vote would not necessarily mean independence would be declared. Mr Zebari said it would merely help Kurds press their case for ""the best deal"" on self-determination once so-called Islamic State (IS) had been defeated in Iraq. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have played a major role in the US-backed campaign against the jihadist group, which seized large parts of northern Iraq in 2014. But while driving IS militants out of the country, the Peshmerga have taken control of disputed territory claimed by both Kurds and the central government. It includes the city of Kirkuk and the towns of Makhmour, Khanaqin and Sinjar - locations where President Barzani's senior assistant Hemin Hawrami declared voting would take place in September. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said holding an independence referendum now would be neither in the Kurdistan Region's interest nor Iraq's. ""The desire of our Kurdish brothers to create a country of their own is their right... and nobody has the right to deter them,"" he was quoted as saying by the Kurdish Rudaw news agency in April. ""But holding a referendum at this time is not right as the war [against IS] still rages, the region's situation is not suitable, and some neighbouring countries believe this move poses a threat to the nation's security themselves.""

She co-founded the TeenTech organisation, which holds events that introduce school children to technical and creative careers. Ms Philbin has also had a long media career connected to science and tech. Her broadcasting career began in the late 1970s when Ms Philbin presented the pioneering BBC saturday morning children's show Multi-Coloured Swap Shop. From there, she went on to work on the iconic BBC science show Tomorrow's World. During the eight years she worked on that programme, Ms Philbin was first to demonstrate many innovations including car navigation systems, fax machines and mobile phones. More recently, Ms Philbin was a reporter on the BBC's Bang Goes The Theory science show, and has regularly appeared on other radio and TV programmes as an science expert. In 2008, she helped to start the non-profit TeenTech organisation that aimed to give young people a realistic view of what it is like to work in jobs that have a high science, technology, engineering and mathematics component. It regularly runs events that let school children talk to people that work in different technical sectors and lets them get a feel for the techniques, equipment and approaches used in those professions. Ms Philbin said giving children an insight into the ways that innovation and advances occur was important because an increasing proportion of jobs revolved around competence in science, technology and maths. It's hard to think of anyone in the last 30 years who has had quite such an impact on enthusing people - and in particular young people - about technology as Maggie Philbin. People of my generation will remember her as the woman who introduced us to everything from sat-nav to digital cameras on Tomorrow's World. But today she is doing amazing work to get teenagers thinking about learning technology skills through her TeenTech organisation.

The company, putting on Shakespeare on Broadway for the first time, is following the Tudor tradition of having an all-male cast playing all of the roles, including the female ones. Rylance, who added that his dog was also making his New York theatrical debut, was called ""astonishing"" in a review by Ben Brantley of the New York Times. ""This is how Shakespeare was meant to be done,"" he added. The two plays and gender-swapping roles allow him to be ""as brilliant in trousers as he is in a dress"", added the review. Marilyn Stasio, writing in Variety, said that Rylance's portrayal of Richard III was ""an assassin consumed less by envy and hatred of his victims than loathing for his own twisted self."" Stephen Fry, making his New York stage debut as Malvolio in Twelfth Night, was praised for his sympathetic portrayal of the usually malevolent character. The New York Times said: ""Malvolio is refreshingly embodied by Mr. Fry with the complacency and affectation of someone you might recognize from your own office."" Brantley said that the two productions were ""a source of radiant illumination for the audience, while the bewilderment of the characters onstage floods us with pure, tickling joy.

Prior to going home, the father of three got into an altercation with his partner's brother, who he claimed assaulted him.

A struggle between the couple then ensued, during which she was pushed into the bath. She them saw Hunt raise his hand, and he struck her twice with a hammer.

He said that when he got home, his partner was on the phone with her brother and that he was ""in fear"". He subsequently pleaded guilty to wounding the woman, and to possessing the hammer with intent to commit assault. The court heard the hammer used was already in the house.

It comes just over a week before the new parliament meets for the first time since last year's election victory by the opposition pro-democracy NLD party. Sentences for nearly 80 prisoners on death row have also been commuted to life in prison. Mr Blackwood's sister, Angela Blackwood, said the family had been told that he would be released in the next few days ""or it could be up to a week"". It was not immediately clear if two Burmese men jailed with him were also being released. Mr Blackwood had posted a picture on social media of Buddha wearing headphones to promote a cheap drinks event at the Yangon bar he managed. Following complaints from monks, he was sentenced to two and a half years with hard labour for offending the Buddhist religion. The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Myanmar says that despite the latest releases, the country's outdated legal system - administered by often vindictive local officials - is still jailing people for political activities, usually unauthorised protests. On Friday, an ethnic Kachin activist named Patrick Khun Jarli was jailed for six months for posting a picture online that mocked the military. Amnesty International said the sentence was ""a stark reminder of how prevalent repression still is"" in Myanmar, and said nearly 100 other prisoners of conscience remained behind bars. Presidential spokesman Zaw Htay said on Facebook that a total of 102 prisoners were being released. One official said 21 of them were being released from the notorious Insein prison, which has long been used for political detainees, in Yangon, also known as Rangoon. Its most famous inmate was Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader whose party won the historic elections in November, ending decades of military or military-backed rule. Myanmar's former military government had been accused of wrongfully imprisoning about 2,000 political opponents, dissidents and journalists over the years. But since 2010, as it began edging towards democracy, it has freed hundreds of detainees.","Philip Blackwood was jailed last March for using an image of Buddha to promote his bar.

It also offers immunity from prosecution to Mr Saleh, his family and aides. Aides to Mr Saleh said he seemed poised to accept the initiative, according to Reuters news agency. ""We welcome this new initiative and we will deal with it positively,"" an official said, after Mr Saleh met GCC Secretary General Abdullatif al-Zayani on Thursday. But the opposition rejected the plan, saying they did not trust the government to keep to the conditions, and reiterated their demand for the president to leave immediately.

The FA insists there is no time frame on when an appointment will be made, with England's next game a friendly in Germany in March, and the final decision will be taken by Clarke, Glenn and Ashworth.

Southgate has left England top of their World Cup qualifying group after victories against Malta and Scotland at Wembley and a goalless draw in Slovenia. He also presided over Tuesday's 2-2 draw with Spain, in which the visitors scored twice in the closing moments. England next play in March, with a friendly against World Cup winners Germany in Dortmund, followed by a home qualifier against Lithuania. The FA will want Southgate to deliver his vision for England's future following a series of failures in major tournaments. There is also likely to be a review of his brief stint in control of the national team.

Following the match against Australia, Wales face Argentina, Japan and South Africa later in the month - those Tests fall inside World Rugby's international window, which mean clubs must release their players.

He said: ""This is another one of the missing links in Britain's trunk road network now put in place. ""The cutting-edge road scheme has surpassed expectations."" Southbound traffic is using the tunnel first, with northbound traffic due to start using it in a few days. After that, work will begin to return the old A3 to nature, reuniting the Devil's Punchbowl with Hindhead Common for the first time in almost 200 years. Construction began on the twin-bore tunnel in January 2007. It is one of the longest in England and is part of a four-mile bypass of the Surrey village of Hindhead. Seven safe crossing points have been built over or under the new road, most of them specifically for pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders. A major new junction has also been built at Hazel Grove, and access roads have been laid for the businesses and properties that used to turn directly on to the busy A3. The tunnel, which will be used by an estimated 30,000 vehicles a day, runs under the bowl which is a large hollow of dry, sandy heath, to the east of Hindhead. The Highways Agency said its safety features include the UK's first radar-based incident detection system and 100% CCTV coverage. The project has won awards for its innovation and its safety record, and has been delivered within budget and on schedule. Mr Hammond said traffic had been held up at the Hindhead crossroads for years, ""hampering the flow of goods and services and blighting the lives of people living in and around Hindhead"". ""No longer. This new road will transform journeys on the A3 - improving journey times by around 20 minutes or more at busy periods - and will deliver a threefold return on investment for the economy,"" he said.

264,39576544,"Elliot Investors' call to remove Antony Burgmans follows the Dutch firm's refusal to enter talks with US rival PPG Industries over a $24bn takeover. Akzo has rejected two offers from PPG, but some shareholders - including Elliott - support the bid. Mr Burgmans and chief executive Ton Buechner say the bid undervalues Akzo. Elliott said it was one of a group of investors that meets the Dutch legal threshold of 10% support needed to call an extraordinary meeting to vote on a proposal to remove Mr Burgmans. That process takes about two months. An Akzo Nobel spokesman said the company strongly supported the chairman and would respond to the request within 14 days as required by Dutch law. ""The removal of Mr Burgmans would be irresponsible, disproportionate, damaging and not in the best interest of the company, its shareholders and other stakeholders,"" he said. Meanwhile, the company has reported Elliot and PPG to Dutch regulators for possibly sharing potentially ""sensitive"" information with PPG regarding support for an extraordinary meeting. It was not clear what rules, if any, the shareholder and PPG might have violated. Elliott, which has a 3.25% stake in Akzo, said it would respond to the company's allegations soon. PPG could not be reached for comment. Elliott, which became an Akzo shareholder in December, is known for its aggressive moves. Founded in 1977 by American activist investor Paul Singer, it made a name investing in national debt in countries such as Peru. The firm is most famous for its long legal battle over Argentine debt, which climaxed when the firm seized an Argentine naval ship docked in Ghana. The hedge fund is also pushing mining giant BHP Billiton to reorganise and spin off its US oil unit. The PPG offer that Akzo rejected on 22 March was worth more than 24bn euros. Akzo shares were flat at 79.12 euros in Amsterdam on Wednesday. Mr Buchner has proposed selling Akzo's chemicals division and has embarked on a series of share repurchases. The firm, which is scheduled to meet with investors later this month, has also drawn opposition from Dutch politicians concerned about potential job losses.","Elliot Investors' call to remove Antony Burgmans follows the Dutch firm's refusal to enter talks with US rival PPG Industries over a $24bn takeover.

""This pitiful promise by Sports Direct to pay just over the minimum wage should not distract from the 'Victorian' work practices at the retailer's massive Shirebrook depot,"" said Unite regional officer Luke Primarolo. ""Nor should it deter HMRC from investigating the possible non-payment of the minimum wage to the thousands of agency staff who eke out a living on the site."" In his interview, Mike Ashley said that workers over 21 will now earn ""around"" £6.85 an hour. When the new National Living Wage of £7.20 comes into effect in April 2016, staff over 21 will earn £7.35. Shareholders, including Royal London Asset Management, were among those who criticised the company, alongside the TUC and politicians. The former shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, called the retailer ""a bad advert for British business"". Shares in the company fell by more than 10% on 10 December, in the wake of the criticism. News of the pay re-think sent Sports Direct shares up by more than 1% in morning trading on Thursday. Earlier in the year staff members told the BBC Inside Out programme that they were too frightened to take sick days, for fear of losing their jobs. But the company denied the accusation, saying staff who failed to reach performance targets were offered support and training.","The new pay rates for thousands of its staff will take effect from the start of the New Year, the company said. Sports Direct - which is controlled by wealthy businessman Mike Ashley - said it would cost £10m a year. But the Unite trade union accused the company of a ""PR stunt"" and of ""gulag"" working conditions at its headquarters. The retailer came under pressure earlier this year for effectively not paying its staff the full minimum wage. It insisted on searching employees at the end of their shifts, which they were not paid for. That extra time meant the average hourly rate was as politicians.

270,21482317,"Sunday Leader's Faraz Shauketaly, who holds dual British and Sri Lankan citizenship, was rushed to hospital after being shot in the neck. A doctor who treated Mr Shauketaly said the journalist was now out of danger. Rights groups say more than a dozen media employees have been killed in Sri Lanka over the past decade. None of the murders has been solved. The BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo says Mr Shauketaly was on the phone to a colleague at the Sunday Leader on Friday evening at his home in Mount Lavinia when the call was cut. Shortly afterwards he answered a call and said he had been shot in the neck by three intruders, who had then escaped. A group of foreign lodgers at his house said he was covered in blood and calling for help. Mr Shauketaly, 52, was taken to intensive care, where doctors pronounced him out of danger and have been working to remove a bullet. Mr Shauketaly holds British and Sri Lankan passports and the UK government has called on the authorities to bring the attackers to justice. Our correspondent says Mr Shauketaly had voiced fears that his investigative reporting might be putting him in danger, especially after strangers had called at his house recently asking for his whereabouts. Four years ago, the Sunday Leader's editor, Lasantha Wickrematunge, was shot dead by a group of masked men on motorbikes. The case, which has never been solved, highlighted the dismal state of press freedom in the country, analysts said. ""There has been a range of attacks in Sri Lanka on journalists, civil society organisations and others in recent years. To date, too many incidents have had little investigation and no resolution,"" UK Foreign Office Minister Alastair Burt said in a statement. The Sunday Leader had long had a reputation for being outspokenly anti-government. Its profile changed last year when it was bought by a well-connected businessman and retracted some of its articles, but it still does a considerable amount of investigative reporting. Last month, Sri Lanka was placed 162nd out of 179 in a Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders.","Sunday Leader's Faraz Shauketaly, who holds dual British and Sri Lankan citizenship, was rushed to hospital after being shot in the neck.

271,35201832,"One council has told BBC Wales it intends using £20m of its cash before any reorganisation. Carmarthenshire's head of resources said he wanted to see the council's money spent in the authority area. The Welsh government said councils had to maintain reserves and it would act to halt ""irresponsible spending"". But Carmarthenshire executive board member, councillor David Jenkins, said money should be spent on boosting the area's economy before any mergers. ""This is common sense. The question we're asking is what will happen to Carmarthenshire's money if we have to merge with Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion,"" he told BBC Radio Cymru's Post Cyntaf programme. Although plans have yet to be finalised, he said the intention was to spend about £20m of £72m earmarked reserves on an ""anti-austerity package"". He said there was money within the reserves ""where the initial purpose has come to an end"" which is the cash which would be used to improve the area's economy. However, not every local authority agreed with Carmarthenshire's approach. Ceredigion's leader, Ellen ap Gwynn, said it was not an example they will follow. ""You can only spend money once. Who knows what will come with these storms, floods and snow,"" she said. ""Personally, I don't see mergers - so there's no need to prepare for that eventuality. I don't think the Labour Party will get a majority in the next election so the proposed plans will not go ahead."" A deal between Labour and Plaid Cymru means the merger process has been put on pause until after the May's assembly election. Leighton Andrews, the minister overseeing the plans, expressed concern over Carmarthenshire's proposal. He said he would ""act to stop any irresponsible spending"" in relation to council's reserves. A Welsh government spokesman added: ""The Welsh ministers already have powers to set minimum level of reserves required to be held as part of the authority's budget setting process. ""Additionally, the provisions of the Local Government Act (Wales) prevent improper use of assets before mergers.""","One council has told BBC Wales it intends using £20m of its cash before any reorganisation.

272,32126847,"St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong is the latest to suffer from what police are calling a suspicious fire. The blaze started in the early hours of Tuesday, causing extensive damage. On Monday fire almost destroyed the 123-year-old St James Church in Brighton, while a separate fire damaged St Mary's Church in St Kilda East. The Dandenong church was one of eight Catholic churches linked to priest Kevin O'Donnell, who sexually abused children throughout his 50-year career in Melbourne parishes. Local media have reported that in 1995 O'Donnell, aged 78, pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting 10 boys and two girls, aged between eight and 15, and spent 15 months in jail. He was freed in 1996 and died in 1997. The other two churches were linked to paedophile priest Ronald Dennis Pickering, who served at various parishes in Melbourne between 1958 and 1993, before returning to his native Britain where he died in 2009. In 2013, both men were on a list released by the Australian Catholic Church of 29 Melbourne priests who it acknowledged were guilty of sexually abusing children. Police would not comment on the fires or any suspects other than to say they were all suspicious and were being investigated separately. But Regional Bishop for the Catholic Church in Victoria Peter Elliott told Fairfax Radio he did not believe the fires were linked to anger over child sexual abuse, but were instead the work of a ""very disturbed person"". The fires come as a Royal Commission into Institutional Child Sexual Abuse travels around Australia taking evidence about alleged child sex abuse linked to churches, charities and government agencies. Local media have cited research by a Melbourne university that found at least five people had killed themselves after being sexually abused by Pickering between 1960 and 1980. Hollywood actress and former St James' parishioner Rachel Griffiths said the church's destruction came as a relief because of its history. ""I was quite elated, like many of my generation, when I heard the news,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""It's always been a difficult building for us to drive past because there's been so much tragedy and complicated feelings, I guess,"" she said.","St Mary's Catholic Church in Dandenong is the latest to suffer from what police are calling a suspicious fire.
