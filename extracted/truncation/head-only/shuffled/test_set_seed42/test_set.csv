Job losses will be among both academic and non-academic staff and Queen's says no compulsory redundancies should be required. ""If we're not competitive we will not attract the best students, and we will not attract the best staff."" Ulster University announced in February that it was dropping 53 courses. ""Some people will now be forced to look to opportunities in other parts of Great Britain and may not return to our economy,"" he said. The cut in undergraduate places will come into effect from September 2015. The Education Minister Stephen Farry said he recognised that some students might now choose to study in other areas of the UK because of the cuts facing Northern Ireland's universities. What's happening is we're going backwards. Queen's vice-chancellor Patrick Johnston said the cuts had the potential to damage the reputation of the university. ""Defunding our investment in skills, particularly at a time when we're trying to grow the economy does not make a lot of sense. The move is in response to an £8m cut in the subsidy received from the Department of Employment and Learning (DEL). Queen's has a current intake of around 4,500 undergraduates per year. It will be cutting jobs and student places, but it has not yet revealed how many. The BBC understands that there are no immediate plans to close departments or courses, but that the cuts in funding may put some departments and courses at risk. DEL's budget was reduced by £62m earlier this year, and its budget for higher education institutions fell from £203m to £186m, a reduction of 8.2%. ""It's the last thing we want to do, but we have to begin to focus on those areas where we can grow the organisation and develop it - it's clear we can no longer depend on the public purse to fund tuition. ""The loss of any place is damaging to our economy, all subjects teach our young people critical skills."" There are currently around 17,000 full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students at the university, and around 3,800 staff. Just under £100m, a third of the university's income, comes from the Northern Ireland Executive.

In a call with analysts, it said it would open 6-8% of new store space over course of the year. The group's clothes can now be bought online in around 40 countries, it said. Mr Isla said: ""Both our online and bricks-and-mortar stores are seamlessly connected, driven by platforms such as mobile payment, and other technological initiatives that we will continue to develop."" This will encompass online apps for all of its brands and a specific app for the whole group called InWallet.

That country's clothing market grew at an average of 3% in the three-months to the end of July, according to the Spanish statistics agency. It also launched mobile phone payment in all its Spanish stores, with the objective of ""extending the service to other countries"". ""And while Zara is available in many of the territories in which they operate [online], most of their other brands aren't readily available outside Europe online. ""So there is a big opportunity there for them to expand online into new territories."" The company also said it had benefited from steady economic growth in Spain, where Inditex gets about a fifth of its sales. Tom Gadsby, an analyst at Liberum, said the firm's ""online drive"" was important. The world's biggest clothing retailer posted net earnings of €1.26bn (£1.1bn) in the six months to 31 July - up 8% on the same period last year. All of the group's brands increased their international presence during the period, with 83 new stores opened in 38 countries. The firm's strong performance sets it apart from European rivals H&M and Next, which have blamed unseasonal weather for below-forecast results this year. ""I expect over the years they may find they don't have to open as many stores to maintain their strong growth rate as the online channel will become increasingly important,"" he said.","How Zara's founder became the richest man in the world - for two days Chairman and chief executive Pablo Isla emphasised the firm's investment in technology, saying the firm had expanded its online stores to 11 new countries in the period.

Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold. Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: ""Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. Nevertheless, the volume being sold ""can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies"", said the report.

""The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect."" Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: ""In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of $80,000 (Â£62,000). While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for ""lone-wolf"" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said. ""The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities."" Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net. Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found.

It was allowed to float freely in June to help kick-start the economy, but critics argued it should have been done earlier. But the government says there has been strong growth in other sectors. But critics say government policies made a bad situation even worse. The decision to delay devaluing Nigeria's currency meant many businesses struggled to get foreign currency to pay for imports, which had a cooling effect on the entire economy.

""I'm frankly not sure if HP is finished with the layoffs."" The company says the cuts will save $2.7bn (Â£1.76bn) in annual costs, although the plan will cost $2.7bn to carry out. The new structure proposed by Ms Whitman sees HP Enterprise focusing primarily on businesses and government agencies, and the PC and printing divisions on the consumer market.

The losses will come in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which is splitting from the printer and PC business. It follows 55,000 job cuts announced earlier this year. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees. However, Hewlett-Packard is still one of the world's largest technology companies, with revenues this year expected to top $50bn. The company will not say where the cuts will fall, but part of the plan involves changing the nature of the workforce. The company famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and grew to be the guiding light of what became known as Silicon Valley. At a meeting for Wall Street analysts, chairman and chief executive Meg Whitman said: ""We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring."" The proportion of workers in what HPE calls ""low-cost locations"" is expected to rise from around 42% now to 60% by 2018. In 2012 it lost its position as the world's leading supplier of PCs to Lenovo.

Conservation efforts should focus on ensuring rare species have enough places to nest, say scientists.

The Shinawatra family are hugely popular among Thailand's rural population but are hated by the urban middle-class and elite who accuse them of corruption. The military seized power in May 2014 in what it said was a bid to restore public order after months of occasionally violent street protests against Ms Yingluck's government. But Thailand has been embroiled in a cycle of political instability since the military ousted Ms Yingluck's brother, billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, as prime minister in 2006. Ms Yingluck was removed by a court in May 2014, shortly before the military ousted her elected government. The anti-corruption agency has also called for her to be personally liable for losses to state coffers. She said the policy was aimed at helping farmers and denied any day-to-day involvement in the running of the scheme. ""The finance ministry oversees damages to the state and is ready to take action,"" he said. She was later impeached over the rice subsidy scheme and banned from politics for five years. Ms Yingluck was not at Bangkok's Supreme Court to hear the indictment. Critics accused Ms Yingluck of funnelling money to her core supporters. Additionally, Finance Minister Sommai Phasee said on Wednesday that the ministry had received a letter from the national corruption watchdog urging it to pursue civil suit against Ms Yingluck to recover losses of 600bn baht ($18.4bn; Â£11.9bn) related to the scheme. Thaksin-linked parties, under various different names, have won every election since 2001. Under the rice subsidy scheme Ms Yingluck's Pheu Thai-led government bought rice from Thai farmers at above the market rate, costing the government billions of dollars. The Supreme Court will decide on 19 March whether to pursue the criminal case.

On Tuesday, officials said nine more bodies had been recovered from the airport.

Correspondents say that given the violence, it seems clear that any pretence at a peace process is now over.

The raids destroyed nine militant positions in the Tirah Valley in Khyber district, the military said. There were reports that the bodies belonged to a group of airport employees who were trapped in the facility after taking refuge from the attack. The airport reopened late on Monday. The number included seven bodies found in the airport's cold storage facility. Officials said at least 29 people were killed in the fighting which raged from Sunday into Monday, including all the militants.

82,40246994,"As the consumer we have been the driver of the UK economic engine - and now you can hear it start to splutter,"" adds Mr Urquart-Stewart, co-founder of fund manager Seven Investment Management. The findings chime with official data from the Office for National Statistics, which shows that wage growth is falling back while inflation is rising, causing a squeeze on household incomes as they fail to keep pace with shop prices. Visa said physical stores saw sales drop at their fastest pace for over five years in May, with sales down 5.3% year-on-year. It is now worth between 11-15% less against the euro and the dollar, making anything we buy with our weaker currency more expensive. ""Our card's maxed out, nothing in the savings account, pockets emptied out and nothing down the back of the sofa."" Its latest survey shows household spending dipped for the first time in four years last month with families ""starting to feel the squeeze"" as higher living costs eat into pay. Josh Beer, from the Illustrious Pub Company, in Cambridgeshire, said: ""More of our customers gravitated towards deals and offers in the past month, it feels as though they were biding their time, and cutting back until they became more confident in the economy."" That leaves shops with a dilemma, shred their often already paper-thin profit margins or raise prices. One of the chief reasons for inflation's rise is the steep fall in sterling since the UK voted to leave the European Union. ""Let's face it, we are skint,"" says commentator Justin Urquart-Stewart. The Visa figures show overall spending was 08% lower than in 2016, the first fall since September 2013. But even though so-called ""experiences"" spending rose, the figures suggest people are still being careful. ""Now is starts to hurt, with inflation above lower pay levels we will all start to feel poorer. The latest official figures showed wage growth behind inflation for the first time since mid-2014, and the Bank of England has said it expects this to get worse. In contrast, spending at hotels and restaurants rose at an annual rate of 3.3%. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.1% in the three months to March, while inflation rose by 2.3% in the year to March 2017.","As the consumer we have been the driver of the UK economic engine - and now you can hear it start to splutter,"" adds Mr Urquart-Stewart, co-founder of fund manager Seven Investment Management. The findings chime with official data from the Office for National Statistics, which shows that wage growth is falling back while inflation is rising, causing a squeeze on household incomes as they fail to keep pace with shop prices. Visa said physical stores saw sales drop at their fastest pace for over five years in May, with sales down 5.3% year-on-year.

Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said: ""We suspect Mylan will continue to receive some heat for its price increases and there will be heightened pressure on FDA [regulator the Food and Drug Administration] to bring competition to the market."" Actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who had endorsed EpiPens, said last week she was ending her relationship with Mylan. Mylan said the generic version would be identical to the branded EpiPen, which costs $600 for two doses. Mylan said it expected to start selling a cheaper generic product ""in several weeks"" at a list price of $300 (Â£230). That is about half the list price of the existing product, which is used in emergencies for severe food and insect allergies. The product generates annual sales of $1bn for Mylan. Politicians and parents have challenged the price hikes, with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton calling them ""outrageous"" and unjustified. ""We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option."" The cost of EpiPens in the US has risen by 500% in less than a decade. Ms Bresch also blamed the complex US health care system for the price rises and said that Mylan took just $274 of the $600 list price, while insurers, pharmacies and other parties shared the rest. She had previously spoken about the importance of the treatment to her family because of her son's peanut allergy. The move is unusual because the branded version is still under patent and other rival treatments have failed to get regulatory clearance. Other drug makers including Valeant, Turing and Pfizer have come under fire in recent months for sharp price increases. The outcry over EpiPen price rises sent Mylan shares falling about 12% last week. They also expire after 12 months. The stock was flat at $43.04 in afternoon trading in New York.

In the UK, 820,000 people have dementia, and this figure is set to double by 2030. In the walking group, the improvement appeared to be linked with increased size of the hippocampus.

It is the highest number in 12 years. The National Police Chiefs Council and the IPCC will examine whether changes to police pursuit safety or training are needed after the rise in road traffic deaths, added Dame Anne. The shooting of Khalid Masood was the only one related to terrorism. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said there were six fatal police shootings between April 2016 to March 2017, up from three in 2015/16. The six shootings included that of Westminster attacker Khalid Masood. The IPCC and the National Police Chiefs' Council will have to get to the bottom of it quickly. Of the 28 who died, 18 were either passengers in the suspect vehicle or other road users. Dame Anne Owers, chairwoman of the IPCC, said the six fatal shootings occurred across six forces. In addition, another inquiry, which is still ongoing, is also yet to find any evidence of wrongdoing by police. And, as the watchdog points out, the number has to be set in context: there were more than 14,700 police firearms operations during the same 12-month period - the vast majority pass off without a shot being fired, let alone anyone dying. However, the sharp rise in pursuit-related deaths - after a concerted effort by police and the IPCC to reduce the number of such casualties - will prompt searching questions. Is it because suspects have become increasingly reckless? The IPPC data also showed there were 14 deaths in police custody - the second lowest figure it has recorded. Or have police standards on the roads slipped? Does the rise simply reflect an upsurge in criminal activity? Twenty-eight of the road traffic deaths were related to police pursuits of vehicles. The watchdog said the investigation into that case and two others had been completed and all three found no evidence of any misconduct by firearms officers. Since the IPCC was set up in 2004, there have never been more than a handful of fatal police shootings in a year, so the fact there have been six is unlikely to raise alarm bells.

Margaret Thatcher's life in pictures But eventually even her own party thought she had been in charge too long - and she left Downing Street in tears. After 11 years in power - and winning three elections - she'd been prime minister for longer than anyone else in the 20th century. One of her biggest changes was that she wanted private companies and people, and not officials, to run government-owned things like British Gas and BT (British Telecom). She was given a ceremonial funeral with full military honours on 17 April. She died peacefully, aged 87, on Monday the 8th of April 2013. And in 1990, there was fighting on the streets of London because of a new tax - called the poll tax - that people thought hit poor people harder than the rich. Now, more than 20 years on, she is recognised as a prime minister who transformed the face of Britain - and will be remembered as one of the most important figures in modern British history. In 1984 thousands of miners protested for a whole year against her plans to shut down lots of coal mines and cut lots of jobs. Under her rule, the City of London became one of the world's most successful centres for banking and business. Thousands of ordinary people were able to buy their council houses, giving them more of a stake in society.","Read more: Tributes to Margaret Thatcher But though she had many supporters, some of the changes she introduced were very unpopular and there were protests and riots on the streets.

The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees. Mr Zuma's decision to appoint the little known Des van Rooyen as finance minister, before replacing him four days later, was widely condemned. The appointment led the rand to tumble to record lows, although it rose after he was replaced by the respected Pravin Gordhan on Sunday night. The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year. But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC. It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising.

The boss of Mears Scotland, Willie Docherty, is a personal friend of the council leader Jim McCabe, one of Scotland's longest-serving Labour councillors. The future of the contract has been caught up in in-fighting between some Labour councillors. Under the terms of the contract, the company was expected to deliver efficiency savings every year. The company was later taken over by Mears. Labour has an overall majority on North Lanarkshire Council and holds all the Westminster constituencies in the area. Councillors on the Policy and Resources Committee are expected to vote to allow the contract to be renegotiated. This was over a group disciplinary matter unconnected with the Mears contract. Recently, Labour councillor Tommy Morgan - who had asked some tough questions over the contract - lost his position as convener of the council's audit and governance panel after a vote of confidence. Mr Morgan also became involved in a heated discussion with other councillors over a proposed school closure. Other options which were considered included re-tendering or going for a piecemeal approach to repairs. The council says Mears has improved the council's repairs service but was losing money on the contract - in part because it had been expected to find efficiency savings every year.","Mr McCabe says he has been open about his friendship with Mr Docherty, whose wife Sadie is the Lord Provost of Glasgow, but insists that would not affect his judgement on the contract.

The rail manufacturer is headquartered in London and builds trains at its plant in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham. ""In total 25,000 jobs and 2,000 apprenticeships will be created during HS2 construction and we have held discussions with UK suppliers to make sure they are in the best possible position to win contracts,"" he added.

Formal invitations to tender will be made in 2018. The contract, which will also involve maintaining the fleet, will be awarded in 2019.

Ministers stressed it was a draft budget and, like all drafts, it was open to consultation before changes were made. In fact, the general cut and the tuition fees policy became enmeshed because the Welsh government had argued that much of the cash reduction was in fact staying in the system because the money was being re-directed to fee subsidies, rather than going directly to the institutions. But nevertheless it was clear that universities weren't happy, and it was adding to the simmering resentment that had already developed over the government's university tuition fee policy. The comeback from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales was that only around 60% of the tuition fee grants will stay in Wales as the fees follow the students, wherever they choose to go. Universities insist the reserves are needed for investment to continue and for the sector in Wales to remain internationally competitive. Labour want the headlines from their latest budget to be about the extra money going into the NHS, and not a fight over funding for scientific research. Be that as it may, there is clearly strong feeling within government that not only can universities afford it, but that their time has come to take a hit after further education colleges took one last year.

Some scientists even speculate that such objects could have been stolen from a star that formed from the same ""nursery"" of gas and dust as our Sun 4.6 billion years ago.

One explanation is that they have been perturbed gravitationally and pulled on to their strange trajectories by a passing planet - perhaps one that was expelled from our Solar System early in its history.

She said the pistol found on Amri when he was shot dead by Italian police last week had the same calibre as the one that killed the Polish driver whose truck Amri hijacked. Then he took a train to Chambery in the French Alps, changed trains, and reached Milan. Amri had links to known Islamists. Government officials have said the lorry's automatic braking system may have prevented the loss of more lives on 19 December. German state prosecutors said they had found the man's number on the phone of Anis Amri, who killed 12 people by ramming a lorry into market shoppers. His body was found in the cabin, after Amri had fled.","German prosecutors say a video in which Amri pledges allegiance to so-called Islamic State (IS) is genuine. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni told a news conference there was no evidence that Amri had any ""particular networks"" in Italy. Amri was shot dead by police in Milan early last Friday, four days on from the attack. The 24-year-old Tunisian had opened fire, wounding one.

Corinthians' move for Tevez - which emerged on Monday - was believed to be funded by a new television deal for Brazilian clubs. Tevez, who had a spell at Corinthians from 2005 to 2006, originally asked City for a transfer in December and has since reiterated that desire to leave so he can be closer to his family in Argentina. He has scored 43 Premier League goals in his two seasons at City - the highest total of any player in the top division. He helped Mancini's side to FA Cup success and Champions League qualification in the 2010/2011 campaign. Corinthians still want Tevez and hinted an agreement can be reached in January. It had appeared that the former West Ham forward had got his wish for a transfer but then in a statement, Corinthians said: ""The board of Sporting Club Corinthians hereby officially announce the impossibility of hiring the Argentine striker Carlos Tevez. However, there are few clubs who can match the asking price of about £40m. But Corinthians said there was not enough time to sign the the 27-year-old before the Brazilian transfer window closes at 0400 BST on Thursday. Tevez, who is contracted to City until 2014, has been a key player for the club since arriving from neighbours Manchester United in 2009. The breakdown of Tevez's transfer to Corinthians also leaves City manager Roberto Mancini's proposed move for Atletico Madrid striker Sergio Aguero in doubt. That would indicate that Corinthians may look to revive the deal in the January transfer window, although that would not be the preferred option of Tevez or his current club. City thought a £40m deal had been agreed for the Argentine striker after he told the Premier League outfit he wanted to return to South America. ""We are aware of the dream our fans had of having this player at Corinthians again and we look forward to him being with us in the near future.""

During Thursday's session, Assistant Chief Constable Higgins also accepted criticism of police intelligence which led to a 91-year-old driver being ordered from his car at gunpoint by four armed officers. But he accepted police intelligence could sometimes get it wrong. In October, following pressure from politicians and civic society, Police Scotland said specialist armed police officers in Scotland would in future only be deployed to firearms incidents or where there is a threat to life. One was stabbed four times, he said, but the officers did not shoot the attacker because they feared it would put members of the public standing nearby at risk. Mr Higgins said: ""Based on the information the firearms officers had that time, their actions were entirely appropriate.

Among those other measures was the announcement that firms making an annual profit of over £5m would face the prospect of having the amount of past losses they could carry forward to offset their corporation tax bill capped to 50% of current profits. To fund the giveaway, the chancellor capped debt interest payments used by larger firms to cut their corporation tax bills, to 30% of earnings. The chancellor also announced a number of reforms designed to help small businesses cope with what he called ""the great unfairness"" they faced when trying to compete with some suppliers selling goods online.

He said that the 600,000 small businesses relieved of paying business rates from next April would see an annual saving of nearly £6,000. Mr Osborne said his business tax reforms were part of a ""Budget for small business"".

As part of its sponsorship, Nissan is supplying 5,000 cars for the Games and the Brazilian Olympic team to use. But a recession has seen that sales figure tumble to 2 million a year. The Nissan boss thinks that the UK will continue to be a ""big partner"" for the European Union, but he said: ""The question is what will happen to customs, trade and circulation of products.

Four-year-old Christoper Milke was then taken by two men to a desert area north of Phoenix where he was shot three times in the head.

""Non-disclosure of this magnitude calls into question the integrity of the system and was highly prejudicial to Milke,"" the court said. Debra Milke, then a 25-year-old insurance company clerk, was accused of dressing her son in his favourite outfit and telling him he was going to see Santa Claus at a local mall. However, Mr Saldate did not record the confession and has since been implicated in several cases of misconduct including lying under oath. The court said on Thursday that it wasn't expressing an opinion on Milke's guilt or innocence but merely on the validity of a retrial. The original trial in 1990 found Ms Milke guilty of arranging the killing, based largely on an alleged confession made to Detective Armando Saldate. Mr Saldate said he feared potential charges if he testified again, and in December a judge granted his request not to give evidence at any retrial. Lawyers for Ms Milke said they were ""thrilled"" at the decision not to allow a retrial. The two men who carried out the killing remain on death row. An appeals court ruled last year that prosecutors had known about Mr Saldate's misconduct but failed to disclose the information. Ms Milke's ex-husband, Arizona Milke, remained convinced of her guilt. An appeals court in Arizona ruled on Thursday that the she could not be tried again in relation to the killing.

He is also a big believer in the digital subscription model - a natural synergy, then, with the FT, which now derives 70% of its business from its online and mobile audiences. But little is known about the man behind the deal - except for the fact that in previous interviews he has alluded to the need for the Nikkei group to expand. The acquisition is being called a bold and brave move for Nikkei - and it is a strategy Mr Kita has been pursuing for some time. The Nikkei group has steered clear of recent Japanese corporate scandals like Toshiba's earnings debacle and the Olympus accounting fiasco in 2011 - a story the FT broke. The acquisition of the FT allows him to realise those ambitions. However, analysts are wondering whether he has paid too high a price for the luxury of owning the FT - three times as much as it is thought the pink paper is worth. FT Editor Lionel Barber has assured his staff that the paper's editorial integrity will not be compromised - no matter how high the price-tag. He owns the Japanese Nikkei group media house, which has just acquired the Financial Times from UK publishing group Pearson for $1.3bn (Â£844m). And he has long held global ambitions for the firm. In 2012 Mr Kita reportedly said that he wanted to make Nikkei a global company, in the same way as the Japanese convenience store sector, which has had success in foreign markets. In 2014 Mr Kita told a group of newspaper distributors and vendors that Nikkei had to strengthen sales and secure revenue in the light of decreasing print circulation figures. Nikkei is one of Japan's oldest and most prestigious newspaper groups, and has managed impressive staying power at a time when the industry is on the decline. Critics say Nikkei is often a public relations machine for Japanese corporates - and that will clash with the fiercely independent Financial Times. But how will the two cultures of the two media houses merge?","But it is the FT's digital success that Nikkei wants to emulate.

But little is known about the man behind the deal - except for the fact that in previous interviews he has alluded to the need for the Nikkei group to expand. The acquisition is being called a bold and brave move for Nikkei - and it is a strategy Mr Kita has been pursuing for some time. The Nikkei group has steered clear of recent Japanese corporate scandals like Toshiba's earnings debacle and the Olympus accounting fiasco in 2011 - a story the FT broke. The acquisition of the FT allows him to realise those ambitions. However, analysts are wondering whether he has paid too high a price for the luxury of owning the FT - three times as much as it is thought the pink paper is worth.

176,19436926,"Their study, published in the journal PLoS ONE, suggests people drink more quickly out of curved glasses than straight ones. However, the study looked only at the time taken to finish one drink in a laboratory setting. However, for the beer drinkers there was a large difference between the two groups. The lead researcher Dr Angela Attwood told the BBC: ""They are unable to judge how quickly they are drinking so cannot pace themselves."" A group of 159 men and women were filmed drinking either soft drinks or beer as part of the study. The group of drinkers was shown a variety of pictures of partially-filled beer glasses and asked to say whether they were more or less than half full. However, researchers at the University of Bristol believe the shape of beer glasses affects the speed people drink. She suggested that people were not concerned about pacing themselves with soft drinks, which could explain why glass shape had no effect on them. The report said: ""Drinking time is slowed by almost 60% when an alcoholic beverage is presented in a straight glass compared with a curved glass."" There was no difference in the drinking time for soft drinks. The shape of a glass has already been shown to affect how much alcohol people pour. They argue that the curvy glassware makes pacing yourself a much greater challenge. A study in 2005 showed people were more likely to pour extra alcohol into short, wide glasses than tall, narrow ones. So it is not certain what happens on an evening out if multiple drinks are consumed. The researchers thought that curvy glasses made it harder to pace drinking because judging how much was in the glass became more difficult owing to its curved shape. While it took around seven minutes for people drinking from a curved glass to polish off their half pint, it took 11 minutes for those drinking from a straight glass. She said altering the glasses used in pubs could ""nudge"" people to drink more healthily by ""giving control back"". The glasses all contained around half a pint of liquid, but some of the glasses were straight while others were very curved. The team said people were more likely to get the answer wrong when assessing the amount of liquid in curved glasses. People drinking from both straight and curved glasses finished after around seven minutes.","Their study, published in the journal PLoS ONE, suggests people drink more quickly out of curved glasses than straight ones.

Det Sup David Swindle, who formed the operation, said anyone with information regarding Peter Tobin would still be able to contact the Anagram incident room via e-mail which would be monitored daily.

The Supreme Court said UK ministers were ""not legally compelled"" to consult the assembly and that AMs have no veto. That means there might be a vote in the assembly on triggering Article 50, as well as in Westminster. The court also said UK ministers were ""not legally compelled"" to consult the devolved legislatures in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. But he said it will not be a veto on leaving the EU. The court ruled Theresa May cannot trigger Article 50 - the formal exit process from the EU - without the backing of MPs and peers. All sides agree the assembly does not have a power of veto. Counsel General Mick Antoniw said he was ""delighted"" by the Supreme Court ruling against the UK government on Brexit. There is a convention - called the Sewel Convention - whereby the assembly has a say on legislation in Westminster that affects devolution in the form of a vote in the chamber. It will not. AMs could decide to hold a vote in the assembly on article 50 if they feel that the legislation on article 50 affects devolution. And if Parliament must vote on Brexit, it leaves the door ajar for the assembly to influence things. I am also sorry to disappoint anyone who hopes that a vote in Cardiff Bay could stop Brexit. Mr Antoniw said there was ""every likelihood of a vote (in the assembly) because a trigger bill will impact on Welsh legislation"". But Tuesday's ruling that AMs do not have a veto on Brexit means that whether or not the vote has meaning will depend on the UK government's reaction. Mr Antoniw told AMs on Tuesday: ""As the Article 50 Bill proceeds through Parliament, we would expect the UK government to respect the Sewel Convention, so that Parliament has the opportunity to listen to the assembly and to the other devolved legislatures."" But there is a political reason for Parliament to listen. Analysis by BBC Wales political correspondent Daniel Davies It sounds like the eleven Supreme Court judges sent the Welsh Government packing.

Why Iran's moderates must capitalise quickly An 18th woman was elected but her votes have been annulled by the Guardian Council, a constitutional oversight body. This shift is also apparent in the fact that almost all hardline clerics lost their seats. The number of clerics in parliament in Iran has steadily declined over the years from 164 in the first parliament just after the Islamic revolution in 1979.

The BBC's Kasra Naji says the results signal ""a major shift in public support away from hardline Islamic conservatives"". The outgoing parliament includes nine female representatives. Islamic hardliners see the declining number of clerics elected as a threat to the Islamic revolution and have called on more clerics to come forward and enter politics - at a time when many ordinary people are turning away from the religious leaders. No reasons were given for excluding Minu Khaleqi after the first round. The election of a record number of women is a sign of a major shift in public support away from hard-line Islamic conservatives who have taken only 26% of seats - a dismal performance. Four women were elected in the run-off, joining other women who had been voted in already. President Rouhani acknowledged the new record and said: ""People chose the best candidates in the 26 February and 29 April elections."" President Rouhani lent support to her in his speech on Sunday when he told an audience ""18 female legislators"" had been voted in.

The earthquake struck as thousands of Chileans were travelling to the coast ahead of a week of celebrations for independence day. The USGS said it was at a depth of 25km, while Chilean seismologists calculated its depth at 11km. At least 11 people died in Wednesday's 8.3-magnitude quake - the strongest in the world this year - that sent tsunami waves as far away as Japan. Small tsunami waves were felt along the west coast of the US and Canada. Hundreds of people spent Thursday night in temporary shelters, while tens of thousands are without electricity. ""Everything is a mess,"" restaurant owner Melisa Pinones told Reuters from the city of Illapel. Large parts of the sea front in the fishing village of Tongoy were destroyed, and more than 500 homes were badly damaged across the region, according to emergency response teams.","Emergency powers mean aid will reach Coquimbo quicker, and allow troops to be deployed on to the region's streets. Visiting Coquimbo on Thursday, President Michelle Bachelet paid tribute to people's response, saying that the death toll, ""while unfortunate, was not very high considering the strength of the earthquake"". President Bachelet said some of Friday's official festivities would be cancelled. Across parts of central Chile, residents began clearing up after what was the country's sixth most powerful recorded earthquake. A one-metre (3ft) wave also reached in Hawaii. ""It was a disaster, a total loss."" Tsunami waves also hit the coast further north and south of the quake's epicentre, with waves half a metre higher than usual as far north as La Punta. Gloria Navarro, who lives in the coastal town of La Serena, said people were ""running in all directions"".

He was responding to a question from the DUP MP Nigel Dodds about the role energy prices played in the closure of the Michelin plant.

210,34118105,"Pope Francis has been viewed as progressive on other controversial issues. The easing of the rules is being seen as a shift in Catholic Church policy, reflecting the Pope's outspoken views on compassion and mercy. The Jubilee Year runs from 8 December 2015 to 26 November 2016 and is seen as one of the Catholic Church's most important events. However, the rule relaxation will not affect Catholics in England, Wales and Scotland as all priests there can already forgive abortion without seeking permission from a bishop. The Pope said many women who sought an abortion did so because they ""believe that they have no other option"". In most countries, only a bishop can approve forgiveness for abortion. However, he has not changed Church policy on contraception. They would then delegate an expert priest to hear the confession. Speaking earlier this year, Pope Francis said that although contraception remains forbidden, there was no need for people to breed ""like rabbits"" to be good Catholics. However, in contrast to his predecessors, he regards compassion and mercy as virtues that outclass all others. ""Unfortunately, what is thrown away is not only food and dispensable objects, but often human beings themselves, who are discarded as unnecessary,"" he added. ""It is horrific even to think that there are children, victims of abortion, who will never see the light of day,"" he said in 2014. He added that he had ""met so many women who bear in their heart the scar of this agonising and painful decision"". Pope Francis is aware that the decision will not be welcomed by traditionalists, says the BBC's David Willey. In 2013, on the topic of homosexuality, he said: ""Who am I to judge?"" The change is only for the coming Jubilee Year, beginning in December. The Pope has previously denounced abortion as part of a throw-away culture. In Catholicism, abortion is viewed as such a grave sin that it warrants automatic excommunication. It normally takes place every 25 years unless a pope declares an extraordinary one to draw attention to a particular issue. ""'I have decided, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to allow all priests for the Jubilee Year to absolve of the sin of abortion those who procure it and who also seek forgiveness,"" Pope Francis said.","Pope Francis has been viewed as progressive on other controversial issues.

Police say that Ms Bland hanged herself while being held in the Waller County jail. The 28-year-old African-American was arrested after a confrontation with a policeman who had pulled her car over. Ms Bland died by asphyxiation after using a plastic bag to hang herself in her cell, according to Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathias.

Mr Mathis has said there is nothing in that investigation ""that shows anything happened but she killed herself"". She was found dead three days later. The jury ruled that neither sheriff's officials nor jailers committed a crime in their treatment of Bland.

Didn't MPs vote against bombing Syria a couple of years ago? For Number 10, that action is distinct from its decision on whether to take military action and have RAF pilots join US forces flying bombing missions over Syria. The answer to all three of those questions is yes. In the PM's view and, he says, the view of the government's most senior lawyer - the attorney general - that made the attack entirely proper and legal. But just a couple of weeks ago, an unmanned British Reaper drone did drop a missile on a group of so-called IS fighters in Syria that killed two British citizens. In any case, isn't it entirely unusual, almost unheard of in modern times, for British military action to take the life of a British citizen? One, the target, Reyaad Khan, was according to David Cameron involved in plotting a barbaric attack on British soil. As the operation appears to have been led by intelligence the truth is we may never know what really happened, what the precise circumstances were.

John Howley, the uncle of Rotherham-based demolition worker Ken Cresswell, who is also believed to be trapped in the rubble, said there had been a ""diabolical"" delay in getting to the missing men. He is one of three men believed to be trapped under the debris of the decommissioned power station. They are seeking ""specialist advice"" on how to progress. The Sun has reported that the third victim is John Shaw, also believed to be from Rotherham, South Yorkshire. ""Given the risks, scale and complexity of the incident and that the building collapsed without warning, emergency services have had to strike a very difficult balance between helping those trapped and injured, recovering the bodies and the need to avoid further harm on the site."" Site supervisor Mathew Mowat said he was seconds from being buried by the collapse.","A spokesperson added: ""Our priority remains the recovery of their loved ones so they can be returned to their families and to understand what caused this incident."" He said: ""It is just the uncertainty - you are hoping that they are still alive in there, but you have got to be realistic and think that it has been going on too long now."" ""There's still a chance Christopher could still be alive,"" she said.

The push has received the backing of GPs with both the Royal College of GPs and NHS Alliance, which represents community services, putting their names to the campaign. It is running a two-year promotional campaign, Dispensing Health, to promote what the UK's 13,000 community pharmacies can do. ""Pharmacy is the third largest health profession (in the health sector) after medicine and nursing,"" says Pharmacy Voice chief executive Prof Robert Darracott. Dr Mike Dixon, of the NHS Alliance, says: ""Community pharmacy is perfectly positioned to take the strain from GPs and A&E departments that are bursting at the seams."" Making sure the potential of pharmacies is realised could also have important implications for the rest of the health service too. It is thought as many as one in seven GP appointments could be dealt with by pharmacies - about 40m a year. Less than a third of people asked in a recent YouGov poll of over 2,000 people were aware of what pharmacists could offer.

Scientists are studying how the Indian monsoon behaved in the past, to shed light on the impact of climate change.

Australian Medical Association president Michael Gannon said children were more susceptible to infections.

Widespread vaccination also reduces the risk of infection to those who, for medical reasons, may not be able to receive the vaccine themselves. Mr Turnbull said more needed to be done, citing the case of a baby who died from whooping cough. And so it protects those few without the vaccine. But as the numbers of those without protection rises, so to does the risk to each of them - something which happened alongside the first death from measles in the United States in 12 years. ""If a parent says, 'I'm not going to vaccinate my child,' they are not simply putting their child at risk, they are putting everybody else's children at risk too."" Vaccines can cause adverse reactions in a small number of people, like many medicines, but the accepted science is that the benefits far outweigh the risks. An Australian Child Health Poll survey of nearly 2,000 parents showed 5% of children were not fully vaccinated. Vaccinating children is not a legal requirement in Australia, but failing to do so makes parents ineligible for childcare rebates. So-called ""herd immunity"" is an important part of public health programmes. Some Australian states already have ""no jab, no play"" laws, but PM Malcolm Turnbull is calling for nationwide legislation.

247,37743433,"The southern region of the country is the most productive area, accounting for 54% of the entire national opium production. Seven insurgents and one officer died during attacks on eradication teams this year. Seven more people were injured. Helmand province, which has seen a resurgent Taliban presence, is the single largest producer, with more than 80,000 hectares of poppy cultivation. Just 355 hectares (877 acres) of poppies were eradicated by provincial authorities in the last year - down more than 90% since 2015, when almost 4,000 hectares were cleared. Earlier this year, the BBC's South Asia correspondent Justin Rowlatt visited poppy farms in the north-east, where one farmer told him the local government knew about his crop, but ""they also know it is the only way anyone can make decent money."" The Afghan government has a stated policy of eradicating poppy crops, but the crop is widespread in many government-controlled regions, and officials are often accused of turning a blind eye. But better farming conditions resulted in a higher yield per hectare, increasing overall production. Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of the substance, which is the main ingredient in heroin. The opium produced from the poppy plant is used to make some of the most powerful medicinal painkillers, such as morphine. UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov said the figures were ""a worrying reversal in efforts"". The Taliban also taxes poppy production in areas it controls, which is a major source of income for its military activities. Growing opium is a crime in the country, but it is still a major cash crop for impoverished farming communities. Taliban militants launched a fresh assault on the Helmand regional capital of Lashkar Gah in early October. However, many nations cultivate their own supply for medicinal use, and Afghanistan's production of illicit opium is primarily sued for the illegal drug trade. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said the area used to farm the poppy plant, the source of opium, increased by 10% to 201,000 hectares. The region was a contested area between the Taliban and Nato-led forces, before the latter withdrew in 2014.","The southern region of the country is the most productive area, accounting for 54% of the entire national opium production.

This deployment allowance is much more than the meagre salaries the soldiers receive from their governments. Amisom officials fear that the late payments are having a negative impact have on troop morale.

Mason Crane, Dawid Malan, Tom Curran and Craig Overton are the other four players yet to make their debut. England lost their last Twenty20 series 2-1 to India in February. Middlesex opener Malan, Surrey paceman Curran and Somerset all-rounder Overton have previously been included in England squads, while Hampshire leg-spinner Crane is called up after impressing in the North-South series in March. Chairman of selectors James Whitaker said: ""The squad has an exciting blend of youth and experience and we are looking forward to a competitive series against strong opposition.","Lancashire batsman Livingstone, who scored 129 from 83 balls for England Lions against South Africa A last week, is one of five uncapped players named. Overton will replace Wood in the squad after the first match, while wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow will be available for the first two matches before returning to Yorkshire. The three-match series starts in Southampton on 21 June. Moeen Ali, Jake Ball, Adil Rashid, Joe Root and Ben Stokes have been rested and will instead play for their respective counties in the inaugural day-night round of the County Championship, which starts on 26 June.

Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said all parties had agreed that the new system introduced on the eve of the 2016 season - where the slowest car is eliminated every 90 seconds in three sessions - was not the way forward.

Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said Todt and Ecclestone refused to revert to the 2015 system despite teams' wishes to do so. The bottom line is if we don't agree to a compromise, then we're stuck with what we've got and everybody agrees that what we've got isn't right."" Teams discussed the failure of the new elimination format with F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone and Jean Todt, president of governing body, the FIA. Horner and Wolff both said they did not know why Ecclestone and Todt were so opposed to reverting to the 2015 system, whereby all eligible cars ran to the end of a session before the slowest few in each are knocked out, gradually reducing the number of cars over the three sessions.

Councillors are to meet next week to consider bids to turn the hall into a food market or a hotel, with council officials backing the food hall plan. The Edwardian building, which dates back to 1911, was closed 10 years ago after a modern new concert hall was opened in the city. At that stage, council officials had backed the view of independent property specialists Jones Laing LaSalle that the Perth Market Place Ltd proposal should be preferred to the hotel bid from the Seventy Group. Decisions over its future have been drawn out over a decade since then, with councillors at one point approving plans to have it demolished, which were subsequently blocked by Historic Scotland opposition. A report to councillors ahead of Wednesday's full council meeting noted that ""there has been a change in circumstances which significantly impacts upon the Seventy Group's bid"", meaning no further information could be provided. Councillors deferred a decision on which development bid to back, if any, in July, calling for further reports from Historic Scotland and other agencies and further information from the applicants. Should this happen, a draft lease could potentially be considered by the council in February 2016, although this would also have to be signed off by the Perth Common Good Fund Committee. The development management committee then backed the Seventy Group plans to convert it into a luxury hotel, before councillors agreed to publicly market a 125-year lease on the building to find an alternative to demolition. The B-listed Edwardian building has sat empty since it closed 10 years ago. However a number of pre-conditions would need to be met before a draft lease could be agreed, at the authority's February meeting. Should neither bid ultimately win approval, demolition could still be an option, although Historic Scotland chief executive Ian Walford warned he would be minded to object to such a move. Planning and development head David Littlejohn has asked councillors to give the marketplace proposal ""preferred bidder status"" to allow detailed negotiations to take place. Mr Littlejohn also noted in his report that Historic Scotland had underlined that ""the process cannot be allowed to perpetuate"", and that a decision will have to be made.","Five bids were submitted in January, which where whittled down to two by July when councillors deferred the decision.
